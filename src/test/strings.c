Notes\\r\\n\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n1. Introduction\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nHalf-Life 2, possibly the greatest PC game ever made in my opinion. \\r\\nHalf-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life (duh), in which Gordon Freeman (the \\r\\ncharacter you play as), has to fight his way out of the black mesa research \\r\\nfacility after a science experiment goes horribly wrong.  Half-Life 2 takes \\r\\nplace an unspecified amount of years after Half-Life. This FAQ will list in\\r\\ndetail the game script.\\r\\n\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n2. Script\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe script I list will only be the scripted (no pun intended) parts of the \\r\\ngame, for example I wont list things that your squad mates say, like Here take \\r\\nthis medkit. I will separate different conversations with simple empty lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2a. Point Insertion\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\nGman-Rise and shine Mr. Freeman, rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply that \\r\\nyou have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest than you.\\r\\nAnd all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until.... Well lets \\r\\njust say your hour has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make \\r\\nall the difference in the world. So wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the \\r\\nashes.\\r\\n(The gman slowly fades away into the background and his image is replaced with \\r\\nthe viewpoint of Gordon Freeman on a train pulling into a station)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 1-I didnt see you get on.  This is my third transfer this year.\\r\\nCitizen 2-No matter how many times I get relocated I never get used to it.\\r\\n(the train pulls into the station and stops)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Well, end of the line.\\r\\n(as Gordon gets off the train he is scanned by a small flying device, a large \\r\\nmonitor with a face on it begins to speak)\\r\\n\\r\\nMonitor/Breen-Welcome, welcome to city 17, you have chosen or been chosen to \\r\\nrelocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.  I thought so much of \\r\\ncity 17 that I elected to establish my administration here, in the citadel so \\r\\nthoughtfully provided by our benefactors. I have been proud to call city 17 my \\r\\nhome. So whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts \\r\\nunkown, welcome to city 17, it is safer here.\\r\\n\\r\\nCivil Patrol-First warning move away.\\r\\nCitizen 3-It, Its all I have left.\\r\\n(the civil patrolman shoves the citizen into his luggage)\\r\\nCivil Patrol-Move it.\\r\\nCitizen 3-Alright, alright I am moving, jeez.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 4-Were you the only ones on that train? Overwatch stopped our train in \\r\\nthe woods and took my husband for questioning.  They said he would be on the \\r\\nnext train, I am not sure when that was.  They are being nice and letting me \\r\\nwait though.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 5-Dont drink the water, they, they put something in it to make you \\r\\nforget, I dont even remember how I got here.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 6-Dr. Breen again? I was hoping I had seen the last of him in city 14.\\r\\nCitizen 7- I wouldnt say that to loud, this is his base of operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon looks down to the end of the checkpoint where he sees citizens\\r\\nbeing led through)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2-You, Citizen come with me.\\r\\nCitizen 8-Wai, Wait a minute where are you...\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2-GET IN HERE!\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2- Go on!\\r\\nCitizen 8-ME?\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2-I SAID MOVE!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to a fenced in area, a civil patrolman blocks his path, he goes \\r\\nthe other way and when he enters the caged area both doors shut and an alarm \\r\\nsounds, he is scanned by a camera)\\r\\n\\r\\nCivil Patrol 3-Dont move, hold it\\r\\n(the side door opens)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 4-You citizen, come with me.\\r\\n(Gordon follows him down a hallway, as he looks into a room he can see a \\r\\ncitizen being intterogated)\\r\\nCitizen 9-This must be a mistake, I got a standard relocation coupon just like \\r\\neveryone else.\\r\\n(before Gordon can see anything more the civil patrol man in this room shuts \\r\\nthe viewing slot on the door)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to the last door in the hall way, the civil patrolman knocks on \\r\\nthe door and it opens to reveal another civil patrolman)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 4-Get in! Need any help with this one?\\r\\nCivil Patrol 5-No I am good\\r\\n(Civil Patrolman 4 leaves the room)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 5-Back up!\\r\\nCivil Patrol 5-Yeah I am gonna need me some privacy for this\\r\\n(civil patrolman 5 uses his console to turn off the 2 cameras in the room)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 5-Now...\\r\\n(the civil patrolman takes off his helmet and reveals himself to be barney)\\r\\nBarney-About that beer I owed ya. Its me Gordon, barney from black mesa. \\r\\nSorry for the scare I had to put on a show for the cameras. I have been\\r\\nworking undercover with civil protection, I cant take too long or they will \\r\\nget suspicious, I am way behind on my beating quota\\r\\n(a man in a lab coat appears on the screen on the console in front of barney)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Yes barney what is it? I am in the middle of a critical test.\\r\\nBarney-Sorry doc, but look whos here.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Great Scott! Gordon Freeman! I expected more warning.\\r\\nBarney-Yeah you and me both doc. He was about to board the express train to \\r\\nNova Prospekt.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well, Barney what do you intend to do?\\r\\nBarney-Im thinking, Im thinking.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Alyx is around here somewhere, she would have an idea of how to\\r\\nget him here.\\r\\nBarney-Well, as long as he stays away from checkpoints we should be okay.  \\r\\nListen I gotta go doc, we are taking enough chances as it is.\\r\\nDr. Kleiner-Very well. And eh Gordon? Its good to see you.\\r\\n(the monitor shuts off)\\r\\nBarney-Okay Gordon your going to have to make your way to Dr. Klieners lab.\\r\\n(there is a loud knocking at the door)\\r\\nBarney-Oh man! That is what I was afraid of! Get in here Gordon! Before you \\r\\nblow my cover!\\r\\n(barney releases the lock on the back door)\\r\\nBarney-Pile up some stuff to get to that window and keep going till your in\\r\\nthe plaza. I will meet up with you later.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon escapes out the window and arrives at another building, a civil \\r\\npatrolman blocks his only path, he knocks a can over)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 6-Pick up that can. Now put it in the trash can.\\r\\n(reluctantly Gordon puts it in the trash can)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 6-Alright you can go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to a large plaza, with gates branching to different areas of the \\r\\ncity, he continues past the plaza outside, beyond the plaza lies a extremely \\r\\nlarge building, he makes his way down the street to a area with 2 buildings,\\r\\none of the entrances is guarded by civil patrolman)\\r\\nCitizen 10-This is how it always starts, first one building, then the entire \\r\\nblock.\\r\\nCitizen 11-They have no reason to come to our place.\\r\\nCitizen 10-Dont worry, they will find one.\\r\\n(Gordon enters the entrance of the non-guarded building)\\r\\n\\r\\n(as he makes his way up the stairs he sees a group of 4 civil patrolmen knock \\r\\ndown a door and rush in too a room, he enters the adjacent room)\\r\\nCitizen 12-Oh, I thought you were a cop.\\r\\nCitizen 13-Dont worry he is one of us.\\r\\nCitizen 12-Look at them down there.\\r\\nCitizen 13-I told you they would be coming for us next!\\r\\nCitizen 12-Just this once I hope you are wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n(as he makes his way further up the building a voice sounds)\\r\\nWarning Voice-Attention residents, miscount detected in your sector\\r\\nCitizen 14-Psst! Hey you! In here! Head for the roof! There is no time to lose!\\r\\nCitizen 15-Run for your life!\\r\\nCitizen 16-Civil Protection!\\r\\nCitizen 17-CPs!\\r\\nCitizen 16-Here they come!\\r\\n(Civil protection starts raiding the building and Gordon runs for the roof \\r\\nalong with other citizens)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 18-Get in here quick!\\r\\n(the citizen shuts the door to the room and holds his body against it)\\r\\nCitizen 18-Head for the roof! I will keep them busy!\\r\\n(a chase ensues with Gordon running across a series of rooftops with civil \\r\\nprotection chasing him)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon reaches a open window and goes inside, he heads down a staircase which \\r\\ncollapses behind him, civil protection close in on him)\\r\\nAlyx-Over Here! Ha! No you dont!\\r\\n(the screen goes white and Gordon is knocked unconscious)\\r\\n(as Gordon wakes up he sees alyx and the bodies of the CPs that were chasing \\r\\nhim)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Freeman I presume? We better hurry, the combine can be slow to wake, \\r\\nbut once they are up you will have a hard time taking them down.\\r\\n(alyx opens an elevator and Gordon heads down it along with her)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener said you might be coming this way. I dont think it occurred to \\r\\nhim that you might not have a map.\\r\\nAlyx-Im Alyx Vance, my father worked with you back in black mesa, but im sure \\r\\nyou dont remember him.\\r\\nAlyx-Man of few words arent you?\\r\\nAlyx-Remember him from black mesa? Your old administrator?\\r\\n(alyx gestures to a picture of the same man that was on the large monitor)\\r\\nAylx-Ha! Dont get my dad started on Dr. Breen.\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2b. A Red Letter Day\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\nAylx-Funny you showing up on this day in particular.\\r\\nAylx-We have been helping people escape the city on foot. Its a dangerous route \\r\\nto my fathers lab through the old canals, today we are finally on the verge of \\r\\nhaving a better way.\\r\\nAlyx-Here lemme buy you a drink\\r\\n(alyx puts a coin into a vending machine, the machine opens like a door to \\r\\nreveal a passage behind it that leads to Dr. Klieners lab)\\r\\nAlyx-Oh and by the way, nice to finally meet you.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon enters the lab and sees Dr. Kliener)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Blast that little.. where did she get to? Llamar? Come out of there.\\r\\nAylx-Uh-oh, everything alright Dr. Kliener?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Oh, hello Alyx. Well almost alright, Llamar has gotten out of her \\r\\ncrate again. If I didnt know better, I would suspect barney of trapping and..\\r\\nMy goodness, Gordon Freeman, It really is you isnt it?\\r\\nAlyx-I found him wandering around outside, bit of a troublemaker isnt he?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-We owe a great deal to Dr. Freeman, even if trouble does seem to \\r\\nfollow in his wake.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-I must say Gordon you have come at a very opportune time, Alyx has \\r\\njust installed the final piece in the resurrected teleport!\\r\\nAlyx-I cant take any credit for the breakthrough doctor.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Nonsense, your talents surpass your loveliness.\\r\\nAylx-Lets just see if this thing works ok?\\r\\n\\r\\n(barney enters the lab)\\r\\nBarney-Well is he here? There you are! Man Gordon you stirred up the hive!\\r\\nBarney-We cant keep him here long doc, It will jeporadize everything we have \\r\\nworked for.\\r\\nAlyx-Dont worry he is coming with me.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Thats right Barney, this is a red letter day, we will inaugurate \\r\\nthe new teleport with a double transmission.\\r\\nBarney-You mean its working? For real this time? Because I still have \\r\\nnightmares about that cat.\\r\\nAlyx-What cat?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Now now there is nothing to be worried about, we have made major \\r\\nstrides since then. Major strides.\\r\\nAylx-What cat?\\r\\nBarney-Doc, since he is not taking the streets you might as well get him out\\r\\nof his civvies.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-What? Oh dear you are right, I almost forgot. Barney I will give \\r\\nyou the honor.\\r\\nBarney-I have gotta get back on my shift but ok.\\r\\n\\r\\n(barney uses a keypad to open up a garage like door, inside this small room \\r\\nthere is a glass case which contains the HEV suit)\\r\\nBarney-Here we go.. Awahh!\\r\\n(Dr. Klieners pet headcrab Llamar jumps on barney)\\r\\nBarney-Damn it! Get it off me!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Llamar! There you are!\\r\\nBarney-I though you got rid of that pest!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Certainly not. Never fear Gordon, she is de-beaked and completely \\r\\nharmless. The worst she might try to do is couple with your head. Fruitlessly.\\r\\nLlamar-Guwakkh!\\r\\nBarney-Get that thing away from me!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Here my pet. Hop up!\\r\\n(Llamar jumps up onto a shelf with some crates and computers)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-No not up there!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-No, No! Careful Llamar those are quite fragile.\\r\\n(Llamar jumps into a vent)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Oh fie! It will be another week before I can coax here out of \\r\\nthere!\\r\\nBarney-Yeah. Longer if we are lucky.\\r\\nAlyx-Barney.. You are not an animal person?\\r\\nBarney-Ugh.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well Gordon go ahead, slip into your suit now.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon steps into the glass chamber and puts the HEV suit on)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well Gordon I see your HEV suit still fits you like a glove, at \\r\\nleast the glove parts do.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-I have made a few modifications, but I will just acquaint you with \\r\\nthe essentials, now lets see..\\r\\n(Dr. Kliener picks up a clipboard with a paper on it and begins reading from \\r\\nthe paper)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-The Mark V Hazardous Environment Suit has been redesigned for \\r\\ncomfort and utility..\\r\\n\\r\\n(A loud alarm sounds in the background)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Oh dear!\\r\\nBarney-Doc we dont have time for this. At least get that suit juiced up Gordon.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Good idea, there is a charger on the wall. I have modified your \\r\\nsuit to draw power from combine energy outlets, which are plentiful wherever \\r\\nthey patrol.\\r\\nAylx-Meanwhile, lets get this show on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Dr. Kliener moves a picture frame around, this opens up a retinal scanner \\r\\nwhich he uses to open up a secret room behind the wall, Gordon enters the room \\r\\nalong with everyone else, inside is a large mass of computers and wires along \\r\\nwith a platform in the middle of the room, Alyx gets onto the platform and the \\r\\nguard rails close behind her)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, why dont you position yourself near the panel over there \\r\\nand wait for my word?\\r\\n\\r\\n(A man appears on a monitor behind barney)\\r\\nEli-Issac are you there?\\r\\nDr. Kiener-Yes, yes, Eli, a bit of a hold up on this end. You will never \\r\\nguess who found his way into our lab this morning.\\r\\nEli-Thats not who I think it is, is it?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Indeed it is, and its our intention to send him packing straight \\r\\naway, in the company of your lovely daughter.\\r\\nAylx-Are you ready for us dad?\\r\\nEli-We are all set on this end.\\r\\nAylx-Then lets do it\\r\\n(the platform Alyx is standing on begins to rise)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Lets see, the massless field flux should self-limit and I have \\r\\nclamped the manifold parameters to include CY Hilbert and GC orbitfold \\r\\ninclusive. Conditions could not be more ideal.\\r\\nBarney-Thats what you said last time.\\r\\nAylx-Hey, uh, yeah, about that cat..\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Initializing in three.. two.. one.. Oh fiddlesticks what now?\\r\\n(One of the plugs comes lose out of its outlet)\\r\\nAylx-Uh, doctor the plug.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Dear me, you are right, Gordon would you mind plugging us in.\\r\\n(Gordon plugs the cord back in)\\r\\nAlyx-You gonna let Gordon throw the switch?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, go right ahead.\\r\\n(Gordon throws the switch)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Very good, final sequence commencing..now.\\r\\nBarney-I cant look.\\r\\nAlyx-Uh, ok, oh ah ohhh!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Aylx disappears from the teleporter)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well, did it work?\\r\\nEli-See for yourself\\r\\nAylx-Hey doc!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Thank goodness, my relief is almost palpable\\r\\nEli-Fantastic work Izzy\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well I cant take all the credit, Dr. Freeman proved an able \\r\\nassistant\\r\\nEli-Lets go ahead and bring Gordon through now.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Right you are, speak to you again in a few moments.\\r\\nBarney-Good job Gordon, throwing that switch and all, I can see your M.I.T.\\r\\neducation really pays off.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Alright Barney, your turn.\\r\\nBarney-Gee thanks\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, as soon as you are in position we will send you to Eli.\\r\\n(The loud alarm sounds again)\\r\\nBarney-And not a moment too soon\\r\\n(Gordon steps into the teleporter, the guardrails close and it begins to rise)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Excellent, initializing, in three.. two.. one.., eh Barney if you \\r\\nwould be so kind?\\r\\nBarney-Good luck out there Gordon\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Yes indeed, we are ready to project you Gordon, best of luck in \\r\\nyour future endeavors, and bon voyage, final sequence.\\r\\n\\r\\n(An alarm begins to sound)\\r\\nBarney-What the hell?\\r\\n(Llamar jumps out of a vent a breaks some wires connected to the teleporter)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-What is it?\\r\\nBarney-Its your pet the freaking head humper!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Llamar? Hedy! No!\\r\\nBarney-Look out!\\r\\n(Llamar jumps onto the teleport as it begins to malfunction, Gordon is \\r\\ntransported to a beach, then back to the lab)\\r\\nBarney-There he is!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Is Llamar with him?\\r\\nBarney-Forget about that thing!\\r\\n(Gordon is now transported to his intended destination)\\r\\nAlyx-He is coming through dad!\\r\\nEli-What is going on Judith?\\r\\nJudith-Im not sure, it seems to be some kind of interference.\\r\\nEli-Gordon stay put we will get ya out of there.\\r\\nJudith-Something is drawing him away.\\r\\n(Gordon is teleported into an unknown location, he sees the same man he saw on \\r\\nthe monitor)\\r\\nBreen-What is the meaning of this? Who are you? How did you get in here?\\r\\n(Gordon is now teleported back to the lab)\\r\\nBarney-He is back, Im getting him outta there.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-You cant just wade into the field! It will peel you apart!\\r\\nAlyx-We just lost Gordon what is going on?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-I wish I knew, Im encountering unexpected interference\\r\\nBarney-Dont worry Gordon we will..\\r\\n(Gordon is transported back to his original destination)\\r\\nAylx-There he is!\\r\\nJudith-Ah! We are losing him again!\\r\\n(Gordon is transported back to the unknown location)\\r\\nBreen-The man I saw, im all but certaint it was... Gordon Freeman\\r\\n(Gordon is transported underwater, A giant alien comes rushing at him but he \\r\\nis transported again at the last second, this time he is outside of the lab\\r\\nlooking in through a window behind Dr. Kliener)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-What do you mean he is not there?\\r\\nEli-He didnt come through.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Then where is he?\\r\\nEli-Behind you.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Ahh!\\r\\nEli-Shut it down! Shut it down!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Gordon run! You must get out of here!\\r\\nBarney-Get down outta sight I will come find you!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon makes his way through the area behind the lab until he sees barney on a \\r\\nledge above)\\r\\nBarney-Gordon! I have never seen the citadel on full alert like that! Take the \\r\\nold canals out of city 17 to Eli, its dangerous but there is a whole network\\r\\nof resistance members who run the underground railroad. I would come with you \\r\\nbut I have to look after Dr. Kliener. Oh and before I forget, I think you \\r\\ndropped this back at black mesa.\\r\\n(Barney throws down a crowbar)\\r\\nBarney-Good luck out there buddy, you are gonna need it.\\r\\n(Gordon makes his way away from the lab and through a train station while \\r\\nbeing chased by civil protection)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2c. Route Kanal\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon makes his way through the sewers of city 17 while being chased by civil \\r\\nprotection, as he rounds a corner he comes upon the scene of yet another\\r\\ncombine beating)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 1-Help me! Stop we didnt do anything!\\r\\n(The combine soldiers are beating the husband of the woman, they notice\\r\\nfreeman and come after him instead, he kills them with his crowbar)\\r\\nCitizen 1-They will be looking for you now. You should run there is nothing\\r\\nelse you can do here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues his trek through the sewers while fighting civil protection, \\r\\nafter passing over same train tracks Gordon finds a citizen and a vorigaunt)\\r\\nCitizen 2-Good god! Guess those sirens are for you huh? Good thing you found \\r\\nus, you are not the first to come through by a..\\r\\nVorigaunt-This is the freeman, the reckoning of the combine has come.\\r\\nCitizen 2-Look we are just a lookout for the underground railroad. Main \\r\\nstation is right around the corner. They will get you started on the right \\r\\nfoot. Meanwhile let my vorigaunt friend here give you a jolt to get going.\\r\\n(The vorigaunt charges up the HEV suit)\\r\\nVorigaunt-That is all we can spare.\\r\\nCitizen 2-Be careful now, we REALLY cant afford to get noticed.  Civil \\r\\nprotection catches you down here, its bad news for the whole railroad.\\r\\nVorigaunt-We serve the same mystery.\\r\\nCitizen 2-Get outta here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to find his way through the sewers and slums of city 17, he \\r\\ncomes upon a combine soldier killing a resistance member)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Wait. what are you.. no.. please.. dont shoot! Ahhh!\\r\\n(The radio in the underground railroad station is going)\\r\\nWoman on radio-Station 12 come in. Station 12 do you read?\\r\\nMan on radio-This is station 8! We heard 12 go down and out! Surgical strike \\r\\nunits are targeting the railway stations! Repeat Civil Protection is coming\\r\\ndown on the stations! We are already getting refuges from 9 and outlying,\\r\\nlooks like..(static)\\r\\nWoman on radio-Station 8 do you copy? Station 8 are you there? We have\\r\\nconfirmed reports of manhacks. Repeat they are filling the underground with \\r\\nmanhacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to battle the combine and go through the sewers, he comes\\r\\nupon a resistance member hiding in a piece of concrete pipe)\\r\\nCitizen 4-Over here! Keep going friend that station was raided but there are \\r\\nstill others up ahead. I am gonna stay here in case any others come through.  \\r\\nGotta keep the railway alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to press on through the sewers, he finds a combine patrol \\r\\nstanding on a grate above him)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 1-Anyone else get a 647-E reading?\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2-Check for miscount.\\r\\nCivil Patrol 1-Still getting that 647-E reading.\\r\\n(They see Gordon)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 3-There he is!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon escapes through the sewer tunnel and heads on, he comes across another \\r\\nresistance station)\\r\\nCitizen 5-Get in here, hurry! Civil protection is on to us. We are tearing up \\r\\nthe railroad, covering up our tracks. Looks like you are going to be the last \\r\\none through. Be glad you are not the guy they are looking for. Poor bastard \\r\\ndoes not stand a chance. Sounds like they are calling in every CP unit in \\r\\ncity 17. Now they are flooding the areas up ahead with manhacks. You better \\r\\nget going before they sweep through here\\r\\n(The citizen opens the viewing slot on the door and is greeted with the site\\r\\nof several manhacks flying towards him)\\r\\nCitizen 5-Oh shit!\\r\\n(The citizen grabs a pipe and tries to defend himself, Gordon and the citizen \\r\\ndestroy all the manhacks)\\r\\nCitizen 5-Thanks for your help.  Look it isnt safe here, I will give you some \\r\\nsupplies to get you going but then you have to leave.  Good luck out there!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to press on into the sewers, he comes to another resistance \\r\\nstation)\\r\\nCitizen 6-Hey! You are Freeman arent you? We got word that you were coming.\\r\\nYou got here at a bad time.\\r\\n(A voice comes over the radio)\\r\\nAylx-Black Mesa East to station 6 do you read? Dr. Freeman is on his way \\r\\ndownriver. Lend him the airboat and give him all the help you can. Repeat \\r\\nGordon Freeman has returned, it is critical he reaches Black Mesa East.\\r\\nCitizen 6-You better get going now.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon freeman heads on past the station, the area up ahead is being hit with \\r\\nartillery shells filled with headcrabs, he reached a small shelter with a \\r\\nairboat and another citizen)\\r\\nCitizen 7-Hey, Dr. Freeman I had been hoping you would show up, got this\\r\\nairboat all gassed up and ready to go. Its gonna be tough dodging civil \\r\\nprotection out there in the open, but drive hard and you will make it. You will \\r\\nfind more help at station 7, just up the river, its the red barn. Climb on in, \\r\\nand fire her up. You had better get going now!\\r\\n(Gordon drives the airboat out of the shelter and out of city 17 and into the \\r\\nriver)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2d. Water Hazard\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues his way down the river and he comes upon a citizen on a \\r\\nbridge above him)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Hey! You down there! Supplies!\\r\\n(The citizen throws down some supply crates)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Look out below!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues on, he reaches a closed floodgate, he goes inside the\\r\\nbuilding and inside he sees Dr. Breen on a monitor)\\r\\nDr. Breen-We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who \\r\\nhas acquired an almost meesianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens.\\r\\nHis figure is synonymous with the darkest urges of instinct, ignorance, and \\r\\ndecay. Some of the worst excesses of the Black Mesa incident have been laid \\r\\ndirectly at his feet. And yet unsophisticated minds continue to imbue him with \\r\\nromantic power. Giving him such labels as, the one free man, or the opener of \\r\\nthe way. Let me remind all citizens of the dangers of magical thinking.  \\r\\nWe have scarcely begun to climb from the dark pit of our the evolution of our \\r\\nspecies.  Let us not slide backward into oblivion, just as we have finally \\r\\nbegun to see the light. If you see this so called free-man, report him.\\r\\nCivic deeds do not go un-rewarded and likewise complicity with his cause will \\r\\nnot go un-punished. Be wise. Be safe. Be aware.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues on and opens the flood gate, and passes further down the \\r\\nriver, after eluding a chopper, he comes upon a resistance outpost with two \\r\\ncitizens and a vorigaunt.)\\r\\nCitizen 2-Hey! You are freeman arent you?\\r\\nCitizen 3-Well! I wouldnt believe it if I couldnt see it with my own eyes. \\r\\nDr. Gordon Freeman himself!\\r\\nCitizen 2-You are just in time doc, we have gotta move out before the combine \\r\\npicks us up, we are getting ready to pull out.\\r\\nCitizen 3-We better hurry, we have to tear down this camp before the combine \\r\\ngets here.\\r\\nVorigaunt-Greetings to the Freeman.\\r\\nCitizen 3-Come on in, I will show you what you are up against.\\r\\n(The citizen leads Gordon into a room with a map and radio)\\r\\n Citizen 3-Here take a look at this. This here is the dam just up ahead.\\r\\n(The citizen points to the map)\\r\\nCitizen 3-The hideout is here, a stones throw away from the apron and nestled\\r\\nin the old hydro plant. But getting there, with that hunter chopper on\\r\\nyour ass, next to impossible.  Good news is, the vorigaunt is working his magic \\r\\non your airboat, so you will have a little more firepower going forward. I \\r\\nthink he is just finishing up now. Go on out.\\r\\n(Gordon goes back to the dock and checks on the airboat, it now has a gun \\r\\nmounted on it)\\r\\nCitizen 3-There we are. That gun came off of one of the same hunter choppers \\r\\nthat you are up against. I always like to bring a little irony to a firefight.\\r\\nVoriagunt-The freeman will accept this weapon, or suffer greatly on the road \\r\\nahead.\\r\\nCitizen 3-Farwell Dr. Freeman.\\r\\nVorigaunt-For Freedom!\\r\\nCitizen 2-Give them hell doc.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon leaves the outpost, just as he gets to the hideout the flood gate \\r\\ncloses and he has to shoot down the chopper)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2e. Black Mesa East\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon passes through the dam and finally reaches the hideout, he enters a \\r\\nchamber but it is sealed and some alarms go off)\\r\\nJudith-We have got something. Okay, its human. Hello? Take it easy in there \\r\\nyou are safe now.  You will have to forgive the scanning process we cant \\r\\ntake any chances.\\r\\n(Some machines begin to run a series of scans on Gordon)\\r\\nJudith-Dr. Freeman? Gordon Freeman?! Is that you? You made it here this \\r\\nquickly? Well is Eli is going to be amazed, not to mention relieved. \\r\\nI am Dr. Mossman, Dr. Judith Mossman. I have been hearing about you since long \\r\\nbefore the Black Mesa incident. Oh! Black Mesa. I do so envy you working with \\r\\nEli and Dr. Kliener when they were at the top of their field. Ah! There we go \\r\\nyou can come through now.\\r\\n(The scanners stop and turn off and the door in front of Gordon opens)\\r\\n\\r\\nJudith-I will take you down to Eli right away. He would never forgive me if I \\r\\nkept you waiting.\\r\\n(Judith leads Gordon down through the facility)\\r\\nJudith-We could certainly use the extra help around here. We have covered a \\r\\nlot of ground in the last few months, but things would go much more faster if \\r\\nwe had more people with your training. We are closing in on a reliable local\\r\\nteleport technology, something even the combine has not mastered. Eli thinks \\r\\ntheir portals are string based, similar to our Calabi-Yau model, but they have \\r\\nfailed to factor in the dark energy equations. They can tunnel through from \\r\\ntheir universe, but once they are here they are dependent on local \\r\\ntransportation. If they knew what we were doing with entanglement...\\r\\n(Judith gets into an elevator and Gordon follows)\\r\\nJudith-Oh listen to me, I sound like a post-doc. I am just so excited to think\\r\\nthat we will finally get the chance to work together.\\r\\n(The elevator goes down)\\r\\nJudith-Were was I? Oh yes, Dr. Kliener compressed the xen relay far beyond \\r\\nanything he imagined at Black Mesa. We figured out how to use xen as an \\r\\nunexpressed axis, effectively a dimensional slingshot so we can swing around \\r\\nthe borderworld and come back in local space without having to pass through.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The elevator reaches the bottom floor)\\r\\nJudith-Oh! Here is Eli now.\\r\\n(Eli is speaking to a vorigaunt)\\r\\nEli-Alright good you keep right on it.\\r\\nJudith-Eli! Look who I found in the airlock.\\r\\nEli-Gordon Freeman! Let me get a look at you man! My god man you havent\\r\\nchanged one iota. How do you do it? Now lets see the last time I saw you,\\r\\nI sent you up for help after the resonance cascade. I never thought it\\r\\nwould take you this long to get back to me. Welcome to the lab anyway,\\r\\nits not Black Mesa but it serves us well enough.\\r\\nJudith-Its going to be a lot more like Black Mesa with Gordon here to help.\\r\\nEli-Right you are, M.I.T. graduates are few and far between these days. \\r\\nWe will get you out of that hazard suit and back into your lab coat where you\\r\\nbelong.\\r\\nJudith-Lemme just finish up some work and I will see what I can dig up.\\r\\nDr. Freeman? It has been a real honor. I am looking forward to working \\r\\ntogether.\\r\\nEli-Feel free to look around.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Eli goes back to his business, after a short while Alyx walks in)\\r\\nAlyx-Ah! Gordon, the vorigaunts said you were here. I cannot believe\\r\\nyou made it so quickly on foot.\\r\\nEli-I believe he broke your record honey.\\r\\nAlyx-Well he earned it. I guess you proved you can handle yourself out there.\\r\\nEli-There is nothing Gordon cannot handle..with the possible exception of you.\\r\\nAlyx-Dad!\\r\\nEli-Haaaa\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx goes and works on one of the machines while Eli activates a display\\r\\nfor Gordon to look at)\\r\\nEli-Take a look at this Gordon.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Judith comes out of the room she was working in)\\r\\nJudith-Alyx I though you were on watch?\\r\\nAlyx-The vorigaunts relieved me show I could come see Gordon. \\r\\nAnyway I should be in here working on the portal.\\r\\nJudith-I have the repairs well in hand. Someone misjudged the capacity\\r\\nof the combine thyristor..\\r\\nAlyx-Are you blaming me?\\r\\nJudith-No it was a calculation error not a mechanical problem.\\r\\nAlyx-Then maybe you should let me do the calculations next time, as well as\\r\\nthe installing.\\r\\nJudith-Alyx really, sometimes I think you deliberately misunderstand me.\\r\\nEli-Ahem. Alyx why dont you take Gordon and show him the gravity gun.\\r\\nAlyx-Sure, come on Gordon, lets go have some fun.\\r\\nJudith-The zero point field energy manipulator is not a toy Alyx\\r\\nAylx-Lets get out of here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx opens up a door with keypad and leads Gordon down a hallway)\\r\\nAylx-So I seen you met Dr. Mossman, she is one of the main reasons\\r\\nI spend so much time outside. You should hear her drone on about how it\\r\\nshould have been her in the Black Mesa test chamber that day. I am sorry\\r\\nI shouldnt be talking behind her back, it just gets a bit cluastraphobic\\r\\ndown here.\\r\\n(Alyx points down a hallway)\\r\\nAlyx-Thats the old passage to Ravenholm. We dont go there anymore.\\r\\nCome on.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx leads Gordon through another airlock into an area outside)\\r\\nAlyx-So here we are, the scrapyard. This is the gravity gun my father was \\r\\ntalking about, you can call it the zero point energy field manipulator if you \\r\\nreally want to.\\r\\n(Alyx opens a glass case and hands Gordon the gravity gun)\\r\\nAlyx-Its designed for handling hazardous materials, but we mainly use it for\\r\\nheavy lifting. Give it a try. The primary trigger emits a charge, you can punt\\r\\nstuff and send it flying. I found it handy for clearing minefields. The \\r\\nsecondary trigger lets you grab things, you can send them flying with the \\r\\nprimary. Once you have picked something up, you can drop it gently by pressing\\r\\nyour secondary trigger again. Pick up some stuff and toss it. You can also \\r\\npull stuff over from a distance. Try grabbing those barrels from that ledge up \\r\\nthere. All right.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx leads Gordon into the scrapyard)\\r\\nAlyx-Now let me call dog, he loves to play fetch. \\r\\nDog! Come!\\r\\n(A large robot comes out of a metal shack on the other side of the scrapyard)\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon this is dog, my dad built him to protect me when I was a kid. \\r\\nFirst model way about yay-high I have been adding to him ever since.\\r\\nOk dog lets play catch with Gordon. You will need to use the gravity gun.\\r\\nGo ahead dog. Throw!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Dog throws a series of crates as Gordon catches them with the gravity gun)\\r\\nAlyx-Dog, go get your ball!\\r\\n(Dog runs over to a metal crate and removes a round glowing object, he throws \\r\\nthis object back and forth with Gordon)\\r\\nAlyx-When I told you that you would be playing fetch, I didnt tell you who \\r\\nwould be fetching did I.\\r\\n(This continues for a short while)\\r\\nAlyx-Ok Gordon lets try something else. Throw something bigger dog.\\r\\n(Dog runs over and picks up a dumpster)\\r\\nAlyx-No Dog! No boy put that down! What is it dog?\\r\\n(A explosion can be heard)\\r\\nAlyx-Oh my god what was that? Scanners! The combine is sweeping the area!\\r\\nWe have to head back to the lab come on Gordon!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon follows Alyx back to the airlock along with dog, Alyx contacts Eli \\r\\nover the monitor)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad its Alyx are you there?\\r\\nEli-Alyx.. Honey\\r\\nAylx-Whats going on in there?\\r\\nEli-Where are you Alyx?\\r\\nAlyx-We are in the scrapyard airlock stuck in a full autocycle.\\r\\nEli-Is Gordon still with you?\\r\\nAlyx-He is right here.\\r\\nEli-Good, I want you two to..\\r\\n(The power shuts off)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad?\\r\\n(The power comes back on)\\r\\nEli-Take Gordon out of here, head for the coast! Do not go through raven..\\r\\n(The monitor cuts off)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad? Dad! Damn it! Dog open the airlock get us out of here! Hurry now!\\r\\nTear it apart if you have to, just get it open! Thats enough dog. Come on\\r\\nGordon! Come on!\\r\\n\\r\\n(As Alyx and Gordon run back to the lab a pile of rocks collapses separating\\r\\nGordon from Alyx, a firefight can be heard taking place, she speaks to him \\r\\nthrough a hole in the rubble)\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon you need to get out of here, I cant leave my father. Dog, take \\r\\nGordon to the Ravenholm tunnel, then circle around and try to meet up with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon follows dog down the hallway Alyx pointed out earlier, Dog opens up\\r\\na tunnel door and Gordon continues on alone)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2f. We Dont Go To Ravenholm\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon fights his way through Ravenholm, a horrid abandoned town infested \\r\\nwith headcrabs and zombies, after a short while he hears a mans voice)\\r\\nFather Gregori-For it was said that they had become like those peculiar demons\\r\\nwhich dwell in matter, but in which no light may be found.\\r\\nFather Gregori-For the days of my life have vanished like smoke, and my bones\\r\\nare parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as fuel for that fire\\r\\nuntil nothing remains but the light alone.\\r\\nFather Gregori-May they become like dust before the wind, may the angel of \\r\\nthe lord pursue them.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes upon a burning yard with several zombies coming at him on fire,\\r\\na man kicks open the door at the top of the yard and kills the zombies with \\r\\na shotgun)\\r\\nFather Gregori-But whos is this? Another life to save? I will keep my eye on\\r\\nyou, more than that I cannot promise.\\r\\n(The man heads back into the door)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to fight his way through Ravenholm when he sees the man \\r\\nagain)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Well done brother. Make free us of my traps. But take care\\r\\nnot to fall in them yourself. Behind you!\\r\\n(Father Gregori shoots a zombie behind Gordon)\\r\\nFather Gregori-In Ravenholm, you do well to be vigilant.\\r\\n(Father Gregori walks away and Gordon continues to move forward)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After a short time Gordon sees him again)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Better and Better! I am Father Gregori, you have already met \\r\\nmy, congregation, aha aha ahaaa!\\r\\n(Father Gregori walks away again and Gordon moves on)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After some time Gordon again sees Father Gregori shooting at some zombies)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Ah! It is you brother! I apologize, but no harm done. My \\r\\nbullets are the least of your concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\n(In the same area Gordon sees him again)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Although they call me crazy I care not, for thou art my helper\\r\\nmy strength, and my savior.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon sees the man soon again on a ledge above him)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Here brother! Come closer. You have stirred up hell!\\r\\nA man after my own heart! Here I have a more suitable gun for you. You will\\r\\nneed it. Catch!\\r\\n(Father Gregori throws Gordon a shotgun)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Good, now keep it close. My advice to you is..aim for the head.\\r\\nHush!\\r\\n(The sound of claws clinking on metal can be heard, the drain pipe in front of\\r\\nGordon begins to shake)\\r\\nFather Gregori-They come! There is no rest in Ravenholm! Move on and I will\\r\\nmeet you at the church.\\r\\n\\r\\n(After Gordon and Father Gregori fight off the aliens, Gordon moves on\\r\\nand sees him again)\\r\\nFather Gregori-How came you here brother? This is the wrong side of town\\r\\nfor you! Did I not tell you to seek the church? Mend your ways before it is\\r\\ntoo late!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues on, as he emerges from a roof hatch he sees Father Gregori\\r\\non the other side of a fence, behind him is the church)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Ah, there you are! At last! I will send the cart for you\\r\\nbrother! It will be but a moment! Patience brother! Guard yourself well!\\r\\n(Father Gregori goes and activates the tiny gondola to the church, while\\r\\nGordon is waiting for it to arrive a swarm of aliens attacks him)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Almost there brother!\\r\\n(The gondola arrives)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Now brother step into the cart! The handbrake brother release \\r\\nit and come down!\\r\\n(Gordon rides the gondola across the fence and into the church area)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Greetings brother! And so we meet at last. You are to be\\r\\ncommended for avoiding my traps. The work of a man who once had too much time\\r\\non his hands, and now finds time for nothing but the work of salvation.\\r\\nI suspect you have little wish to remain in Ravenholm, so I will show you to\\r\\nthe mines. As for me..A shepherd must tend to his flock... Especially when\\r\\nthey have grown unruly. Follow me brother, and tread lightly, for this is\\r\\nhallowed ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon and Father Gregori fight their way past the area behind the church,\\r\\nand past a graveyard to the mine entrance)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Farwell brother! I fear I deliver you to a darker place.\\r\\nMay the light of lights be with you. Look to your own, salvation.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Father Gregori runs off to kill some zombies, and Gordon heads into the \\r\\nmines, Gordon finally makes his way out of the mines, and emerges onto some\\r\\ntrain tracks, there are combine snipers here, after killing them he finds a\\r\\nfirefight going on between resistance members and the combine, he jumps in\\r\\nand helps, after this is over the citizens survey the damage)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 1-Who is hurt?\\r\\nCitizen 2-Winston has been hit.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Patch him up and get him to the back as soon as he is stable.\\r\\n(He notices Gordon)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Gordon Freeman? Its incredible you made it! We have been getting\\r\\ncommunications from Alyx. I will see if I can reach her again. Follow me.\\r\\n(He leads Gordon to a door, then knocks on it)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Its Leon, we are all clear. And I have got Gordon Freeman!\\r\\n(The door opens)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Dr. Freeman you are kidding? I have been on the line with Alyx.\\r\\nHer father has been captured.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Over here Dr. Freeman.\\r\\nVorigaunt-The Eli Vance is indispensable to the liberation.\\r\\n(The citizen leads Gordon to a monitor, he tunes it and Alyx appears)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Alyx its Leon, and I have got Gordon Freeman with me.\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon! You made it through Ravenholm? Thank god! I need your help!\\r\\nThey have taken my father! He has been taken to Nova Prospekt. The vorigaunts\\r\\ntracked the ship that made off with him and Judith Mossman. While the trains\\r\\nare still running I am going to hitch a ride. Here is where you come in\\r\\nGordon. I need you to make your way along the coast until you get to\\r\\nNova Prospekt. It used to be a high security prison, its something much\\r\\nworse than that now. But I think it is still easier to sneak in than to\\r\\nbreak out.\\r\\nCitizen 1-You want him to take the coast road? He wont last five minutes on\\r\\nfoot. Its antlion spawning season.\\r\\nAlyx-Thats why I called you Leon. I was hoping you still had the scout car we\\r\\nleft with you last summer. The one my dad rigged with the tau cannon.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Yeah good idea, hold on a sec.\\r\\n(The citizen tunes the radio again)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Noriko? Bring the buggy out put it on the dock right now, Gordon\\r\\nFreeman will be driving it!\\r\\nCitizen on radio-Will do! I just finished mounting an ammo crate on the back.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Good timing. Ok Alyx we are all set.\\r\\nAlyx-Thanks Leon. Gordon I have not driven the coast in over a year, but I\\r\\nhave no reason to think its gotten any safer. Meet me in the depot where the\\r\\ntrains unload. Take care of yourself and I will see you in Nova Prospekt.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Bye Alyx. Ok doc, before you hit the road you might wanna grab some\\r\\nmedkits, restock on ammo, maybe check the map see where you are headed. There\\r\\nis an ammo supply crate on the back of the car if that is any comfort. Stay\\r\\nwith the car, make use of the thumpers, and you will stand a fair chance\\r\\nagainst the antlions. I will radio ahead to let the next base know you are\\r\\ncoming.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon heads out to the dock where the car is waiting)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2g. Highway 17\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(As Gordon comes out onto the dock he can see the car waiting for him,\\r\\nand a large crane with a magnet on it)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen in crane-Hello Dr. Freeman, the car is all ready for you. Hop in and\\r\\nI will lower you down to the beach! Good here we go!\\r\\n(The citizen in the crane begins to lower Gordon and the car down to the\\r\\nbeach)\\r\\nCitizen in crane-Damn magnet is failing! Hold on!\\r\\n(The car falls to the beach upside down)\\r\\nCitizen in crane-Sorry doc!\\r\\n(Gordon rights the car with the gravity gun a drives off)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After a while Gordon comes to another resistance outpost)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Gordon Freeman! Hurry get in the basement! We are expecting\\r\\ngunships at any moment. Colonel Cubbage will be glad to see you made it.\\r\\n(Gordon heads down into the basement of the building where a man is \\r\\nspeaking to some other resistance members)\\r\\nColonel Cubbage-This steerable rocket launcher is our best bet for taking\\r\\ndown a gunship. Ah! Hello, I will be right with you. Now.. where was I? \\r\\nAh yes.. Using the laser guide, you can steer you rocket past the gunship\\r\\ndefenses and prevent it from shooting down your rocket. This will only anger\\r\\nit at first. But if you can survive long enough to make several direct hits,\\r\\nyou will be rewarded with a prize worthy of any mantle piece. Now? Who is\\r\\ngoing to be the lucky one to carry it into combat? Ah yes Gordon Freeman.\\r\\nI could not have asked for a finer volunteer.\\r\\n(Gordon takes the RPG)\\r\\nColonel Cubbage-Colonel Odessa Cubbage at your service.\\r\\n\\r\\n(An alarm begins to sound)\\r\\nCitizen 2-Gunship!\\r\\nColonel Cubbage-Damn! Let me just send a warning to lighthouse point, then I\\r\\nwill come right up and lend a hand!\\r\\n(Gordon goes outside and shoots down the gunship, he goes back down to the\\r\\nbasement)\\r\\nColonel Cubbage-Well thats that. I gather you have disposed of that gunship\\r\\nDr. Freeman, your reputation is well deserved. I will have someone open the\\r\\ngate for you immediately.\\r\\n(Gordon goes outside, a citizen opens the gate for him and he drives off)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2h. Sandtraps\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(After driving for a very long time, Gordon comes to a resistance outpost\\r\\nstationed at a lighthouse)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Hey over here! You made it! We are picking up radio chatter,\\r\\nthey are looking for your car. Get you car in the garage.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon drives his car into the garage and leaves it there, as this is\\r\\nhis destination)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Ok doc you will have to go on foot from here. There is a secret\\r\\npath along the cliffside, but no one is going anywhere until we fight off \\r\\nthis attack. Having you here to fight alongside us is going to make a big\\r\\ndifference for morale. Oh crap! Here come the dropships!\\r\\n(Gordon fights off the combine along with the resistance members, after the\\r\\nbattle one of them comes up and shows Gordon the way down the path)\\r\\nCitizen 2-This way Dr. Freeman, we will take the cliff path before the\\r\\ngunships find us. Right along there, and watch your step.\\r\\n(The secret door opens up and Gordon goes on foot down the path along\\r\\nthe edge of the cliff)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After a short while Gordon comes to a citizen and his friend\\r\\nlaying injured on a rock in the middle of the sand)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Hey you there! Dont move! Stay on the rocks! Stepping on the sand\\r\\nmakes the antlions crazy!\\r\\n(The injured citizen begins to get up)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Lazlo dont move!\\r\\n(The antlions crawl up from the sand and kill the injured citizen)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Dear god! Poor Lazlo. The finest mind of his generation come to\\r\\nsuch an end. You go on. There is nothing else you can do here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues on across the beach when he comes upon a very large\\r\\nantlion he kills it, and a vorigaunt emerges from a nearby outpost)\\r\\nVorigaunt-The freeman would be wise to heed out extraction of the \\r\\nmyrmadonts aromatic pheropods, the process is not entirely hygienic so\\r\\nplease, stand aside.\\r\\n(The vorigaunt harvests the bugbait from the corpse of the super antlion)\\r\\nVorigaunt-The freeman will have need of these on the road ahead. Gather them\\r\\nnow.\\r\\n(The vorigaunt leads Gordon back into the outpost and gives him some simple\\r\\ntraining on how to use the bugbait, he then raises a barrier and lets Gordon\\r\\nleave)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon fights his way up the beach with the antlions helping him,\\r\\nafter a while he finally reaches Nova Prospekt)\\r\\n \\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2i. Nova Prospekt\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to fight his way on through Nova Prospekt with his army\\r\\nof antlions)\\r\\n\\r\\nNo dialogue in this level\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2j. Entanglement\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(Gordon finally meets up with Alyx after a short while, unfortunately he has \\r\\nlost control of the antlions and can no longer herd them)\\r\\nAlyx-I am glad you made it here in one piece. My dad is up there somewhere, in\\r\\nthat holding area. Its gonna take some doing to get him out. Lets get out of\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon follows her down an elevator)\\r\\nAlyx-I am afraid that I am flying blind here. Every now and then a vorigaunt\\r\\ngets captured and sends back a little picture of this place. What we do know,\\r\\nis all bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon fights his way along with Alyx and they come to a control room, she\\r\\nfinds her dad and they go after him, they come to the holding room where he is)\\r\\nAlyx-There he is!\\r\\nEli-Alyx! Gordon! Is that really you? I cant believe you found me!\\r\\nAlyx-Dad are you alright?!\\r\\nEli-Im fine but you have to get out of here.\\r\\nAlyx-We are here to get you out dad!\\r\\nEli-Nevermind me save yourselves!\\r\\nAylx-No we are not leaving you! I think I can recalibrate the combine portal\\r\\nto get us out of here.\\r\\nEli-But where will you go?\\r\\nAlyx-I talked to Dr. Kliener, his portal was almost working again. If he has\\r\\nmanaged to repair it then we will end up there. If he hasnt well... we would\\r\\nnot be any worse off.\\r\\nEli-Its not worth the risk honey! I cant lost you! Get out while you still \\r\\ncan!\\r\\nAlyx-We are not leaving here without you, thats final!\\r\\nEli-We cant leave without Judith either.\\r\\nAlyx-Dont worry dad we will find her. For now I am going to send you to the\\r\\nteleport room. I am not saying goodbye dad. We will meet you there.\\r\\nEli-I know you will honey.\\r\\n(Alyx uses the controls to send the pod Eli is in to the teleport room)\\r\\nAylx-Lets get out of here. I am going to head back to the security station\\r\\nand try to patch into your suit radio.\\r\\n(Alyx goes back while Gordon heads forward)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx speaks through the suit)\\r\\nAlyx-Hey it worked, lets see what I can do to clear the way for you, keep an\\r\\neye out for Mossman. I will get my dad through the prison as far as I can then\\r\\nI will catch up to you.\\r\\n(Gordon comes to a closed gate)\\r\\nAlyx-Hang on I will get that gate open.\\r\\n(The gate opens)\\r\\n(Gordon comes to another closed gate)\\r\\nAlyx-Damn! It is jammed ok I have got an idea, head back to that office.\\r\\n(Gordon goes back and finds a vent he goes through)\\r\\nAlyx-Be careful Gordon I am picking up a lot of soldiers ahead.\\r\\n(Gordon comes to another gate)\\r\\nAlyx-I will start working on this gate, hang on.\\r\\n(Gordon moves on)\\r\\nAlyx-You are coming up to another control room, looks like it is still\\r\\noccupied.\\r\\n(Gordon clears the room)\\r\\nAlyx-My guess is that there are a bunch more soldiers heading your way.\\r\\nQuick search the room. There should be some combine turrets nearby. I can\\r\\nreprogram these turrets to attack the enemy. You set them up to defend the\\r\\ncontrol room. I cant shut down those fields from here. I am going to have to \\r\\ncatch up with you to access them. I am picking up a lot of incoming soldiers,\\r\\nhold the fort until I get there.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon defends the room until Alyx falls down out of a vent in the ceiling)\\r\\nAlyx-Sorry it took me so long. Glad to see you are okay. Lets see if we can\\r\\nfind Mossman. It looks like this station might give me better access.\\r\\n(Alyx scrolls through some cameras and finds her)\\r\\nAlyx-There she is. Wait a minute. How did she..?\\r\\n(Mossman is talking to Dr. Breen)\\r\\nBreen-...from your area\\r\\nJudith-I am not calling about that, you promised you were not going to touch\\r\\nEli\\r\\nAlyx-What is she up to? Oh my god.\\r\\nBreen-The soldiers were a bit overzealous I admit, but he was too tempting\\r\\na prize to turn loose, especially in the absence of Gordon Freeman.\\r\\nJudith-You would have had Freeman if you had just been patient and waited\\r\\nfor my signal.</pre><pre id=\\\"faqspan-2\\\">\\r\\nBreen-We were not entirely sure you were ever going to get around to that,\\r\\nhuman loyalties being what they are.\\r\\nJudith-Dr. Breen, as I have stated before you have to let Eli come around\\r\\non his own, you cannot just..\\r\\nBreen-I have known Dr. Vance far longer than you my dear. I am afraid your\\r\\nfeelings for him might have blinded you.\\r\\nJudith-Feelings?  This has nothing to do with feelings. It is a simple truth\\r\\nthat when Eli believes in our..\\r\\nBreen-This is not open to debate Dr. Mossman.\\r\\nJudith-Doctor please..\\r\\nBreen-So sorry Judith I am all out of time.\\r\\n(The monitor shuts off)\\r\\nAlyx-Damn her! I dont believe this! Come on Gordon now we really have to\\r\\nhurry. Go on ahead I will disrupt the next level of security and will catch\\r\\nup to you when I can.\\r\\n(Gordon goes on ahead)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to a room with 3 turrets in it)\\r\\nAlyx-Quick get these set up, I see soldiers coming in from all directions.\\r\\n(Gordon sets up the turrets)\\r\\nAlyx-Here they come!\\r\\n(After a while of fighting of soldiers, Alyx talks to Gordon again)\\r\\nAlyx-Ok Gordon I am going to leave off here and catch up with you. be there as\\r\\nsoon as I can.\\r\\n(Alyx jumps down from a balcony above)\\r\\nAlyx-Sorry to take so long Gordon, I wont leave you again, now, lets go\\r\\ntrack down Mossman.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx and Gordon head off to find Mossman, after a short distance they come to\\r\\na hallway, all the lights are shut off one by one)\\r\\nAlyx-uh-oh\\r\\n(A horde of Combine soldiers pour in, Gordon and Alyx fight them off and head\\r\\non)\\r\\n\\r\\n(They come to a control room)\\r\\nAlyx-Great another security station.\\r\\n(Alyx uses her hacking tool to hack the security station)\\r\\nAlyx-Alright Mossman where are you...\\r\\n(The monitor cycles to a image of Judith in a control room)\\r\\nAlyx-Ha! There you are!\\r\\n(Alyx inputs some commands and seals off the station that Judith is at)\\r\\nAlyx-Ha! Got you now! Well come on Gordon we dont want to keep her waiting.\\r\\n(They head to the next room, combine soldiers come out of a field gate)\\r\\nAlyx-Come on Gordon! Let me seal this door. No turning back now.\\r\\n\\r\\n(They run up to a window and see Judith inside)\\r\\nAylx-There she is. Leave the talking to me Gordon. We may need her to get\\r\\nout of here.\\r\\n(Alyx goes and bangs on the window)\\r\\nJudith-Hello? Oh thank god.. Someone is here. Alyx? Gordon? How did you get in\\r\\nhere?\\r\\nAylx-We know all about you and Breen. You have been a spy for the combine the \\r\\nwhole time.\\r\\nJudith-What? What are you talking about?\\r\\n(The sealed door begins to give way under the combine battery)\\r\\nAlyx-Dammit, move back Mossman we are coming in.\\r\\n(Alyx opens the door to the room)\\r\\nJudith-Alyx whatever you may think I assure you I am working to protect your\\r\\nfather.\\r\\nAylx-Shut up and be glad you are still of some use to us! We are going to \\r\\nreconfigure this teleport and get the hell out of here.\\r\\nJudith-You see we are working to the same end. I have already modulated the\\r\\nteleporter to emulate a xen relay.\\r\\nAylx-That is my fathers work you stole!\\r\\nJudith-Its my work to! And I had to prove to Dr. Breen that your father \\r\\nwould be the most valuable member of any research effort going forward from \\r\\nhere.\\r\\nAlyx-Enough of your bullshit!\\r\\n(The monitor shows Eli)\\r\\nAlyx-Look Gordon there is my dad, I am going to bring him in.\\r\\nJudith-You found Eli?\\r\\nAlyx-No thanks to you! Just enter the coordinates for Dr. Klieners lab and\\r\\nlets get moving.\\r\\nJudith-But we need access to the teleport platform and we are locked out.\\r\\nAlyx-I will take care of that.\\r\\n(The door to the teleport room opens)\\r\\nAlyx-Lets get going.\\r\\n\\r\\n(They all head into the teleport room which contains a teleport similar to the\\r\\none in Dr. Klieners lab but it is much taller)\\r\\nAylx-Oh my god. And you have been working with this thing? For how long?\\r\\nJudith-Never.. Until now. Though I did have a fairly good idea of what to\\r\\nexpect.\\r\\n(Eli comes in on the prison pod)\\r\\nAylx-I bet you did. It looks like it is waiting for us.\\r\\nJudith-The combine use a peculiar pulse-forming network with a very long\\r\\nrise time, It takes quite a while to recharge.\\r\\nAlyx-So you have warmed it up for us. Good. And just in time.\\r\\n(The prison pod opens)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad down here. Sorry we took so long I hope that was not too bad for you.\\r\\nEli-Do not worry about me sweetheart. Judith! I see they set you free!\\r\\nAylx-Not exactly.\\r\\nJudith-Eli! I was so worried about you!\\r\\nAlyx-The coordinates Dr. Mossman.\\r\\n(A large bang is heard at the sealed door)\\r\\nEli-So this is the combine portal, It is smaller than I imagined.\\r\\n(Eli is moved into the portal)\\r\\nAlyx-Hurry up Mossman!\\r\\n(Alyx contacts Dr. Kliener over the terminal)\\r\\nAylx-Dr. Kleiner!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Yes Alyx where are you?\\r\\nAlyx-We are in Nova Prospekt, and we are running the Xen emulation for the\\r\\nfirst time. Are you ready for us?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Ready! Willing! And fully enabled!\\r\\nAlyx-Good we will send my dad through first, he is in position for...\\r\\n(An alarm sounds)\\r\\nAylx-What was that? Hold on gotta bring this back down.\\r\\n(Mossman sneaks into the portal and starts it)\\r\\nAlyx-No! Stop! What are you doing!\\r\\nJudith-I am sorry Alyx, it is the only way.\\r\\nAlyx-No! Get back here!\\r\\nEli-Whats going on Alyx? Judith?\\r\\n(The portal starts to rise, as Alyx tries to stop it, it activates)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener you have to stop them!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Stop who my dear?\\r\\nAlyx-Oh my god! What coordinates are these? Where did she take him!\\r\\n(Another large bang is heard at the door)\\r\\nAlyx-No.. Cover me Gordon I have to reset the portal. Use the turrets!\\r\\n(A series of several bangs can be heard, the doors to the room finally\\r\\n are blown open by the combine, Gordon and alyx fight them off until the\\r\\nportal is ready)\\r\\nAlyx-Thank god it is done lets get the hell out of here!\\r\\n(Alyx and Gordon run into the portal, as it begins to raise the remaining\\r\\ndoors to the room blow open and soldiers flood out, the building begins to\\r\\ncollapse, just as a large cement piece is about to fall on the portal\\r\\nthey are teleported and the screen goes white)\\r\\n\\r\\n(The screen fades back in to reveal the room in Dr. Klieners lab with the\\r\\nteleporter in it)\\r\\nAlyx-My god we made it! But where is Dr. Kliener?\\r\\n(Alyx bangs on the secret wall)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener let us out!\\r\\n(Dr. Kliener pops in with a shotgun)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Aylx? Gordon? My god how did you get here and when?\\r\\nAlyx-What is wrong?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-My dear, I had given up hope of ever seeing you again.\\r\\nAlyx-I was thinking the same. I think the teleport exploded just as we made\\r\\nit out.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Indeed it did. And the repercussions were felt far and wide..\\r\\nbut that was over a week ago.\\r\\nAlyx-What do you mean? Gordon and I were just there a minute ago.\\r\\nDr. Kiener-Fascinating. We seem to have developed a slow teleport. This\\r\\nsuggests an entirely new line of investigation.\\r\\nAlyx-A week..? Then what have we missed?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-A great deal my dear. The blow you struck at Nova Prospekt was\\r\\ntaken as a signal to start the uprising.\\r\\nAlyx-But what about my father?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well.. that is most disturbing. According to the vorigaunts\\r\\nhe is a prisoner at the citadel.\\r\\nAlyx-We have got to get my father out.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Barney has been leading a push with that very aim in mind.\\r\\nAnd another of your friends arrived several days ago.\\r\\n(Dr. Kliener opens the room where the HEV suit used to be, inside is Dog)\\r\\nAlyx-Dog! You made it!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-So there. You see? Its not all hopeless.\\r\\nAlyx-I wish I shared your optimism doctor.\\r\\n(Barney appears over a monitor)\\r\\nBarney-Doc come in.. are you there?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Yes barney and I am no longer alone. Alyx and Gordon have just\\r\\narrived.\\r\\nBarney-Well man thats good news, I almost gave you guys up for lost.\\r\\nWe are going to set up a staging area for the attack on the citadel.\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon and dog can head your way. I want to get Dr. Kliener somewhere\\r\\nsafer.\\r\\nBarney-I will take all the help I can get. Oh crap! Incoming!\\r\\n(A artillery shell flies by barney)\\r\\nBarney-Get going!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon and Dog head out of the lab and onto the streets of City 17)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\nAnti-Citizen One\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(As Gordon and Dog head out to the streets a combine tank drives up, Dog picks \\r\\nit up and throws it into a building filled with soldiers, he then pries open a\\r\\nbarricade to let Gordon past, after Gordon is past he shuts it and jumps onto\\r\\na dropship, the dropship flies off with Dog on it)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon meets up with some resistance members)\\r\\nResistance 1-Well Gordon Freeman, and about time to\\r\\nResistance 2-Gordon you are here!\\r\\nResistance 3-Dr. Freeman we are coming with you\\r\\n(They head off and continue on)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to an area sealed off by twisted metal and concrete)\\r\\nResistance 4-Gordon Freeman? It is you isnt it! Give me a minute, Im gonna\\r\\nplant some charges and blow this open.\\r\\n(After holding off combine forces for some time the area is blow open)\\r\\nResistance 4-Looks nasty in there! Good thing you have that suit!\\r\\n(Gordon makes it past the area and opens the locked door)\\r\\nResistance 4-I see you made it through okay, I figured you would.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon finds a resistance member through a fence)\\r\\nResistance 5-Dr. Freeman? It is not safe here anymore. They are shelling the\\r\\nhell out of us. I will send word you are coming up ahead. Keep moving.\\r\\n(Gordon continues on with his squad)\\r\\n\\r\\n(He comes to a room with 2 turrets, after knocking them down the door blows\\r\\nopen and Alyx comes in)\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon! I had a feeling I would find you here. I have got Dr. Kliener in\\r\\na safe spot. Now we can join up with Barney. There is a command center \\r\\ndownstairs, I am hoping to find information on generator locations. Ready?\\r\\nLets go.\\r\\n(Gordon and Alyx go downstairs and reach the command center)\\r\\nAlyx-Well we are in luck, there is a generator in the square outside. We are\\r\\ntrying to disable as many as we can to loosen the combines grip on the city.\\r\\nIt will take me a few minutes to expose the core, then I will need you to hit\\r\\nit with a burst from the gravity gun. In the meantime watch my back.\\r\\n(Gordon and Alyx head outside to the plaza, Alyx starts to disable the\\r\\ngenerator)\\r\\nAlyx-This should not take too long. As soon as it is down, I will open that\\r\\ngate and we can get out of here.\\r\\n(Gordon fights off the combine forces as Alyx tries to open the generator)\\r\\nAlyx-Ok the core is exposed. Use the gravity gun Gordon!\\r\\n(Gordon uses the gravity gun to push the energy source out of the core)\\r\\nAlyx-All right, I am opening the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n(They both run through the gate and Alyx shuts it)\\r\\nAlyx-Ok, Barney should be on the far side of that...canal. Well there used to\\r\\nbe a bridge here. Let me see if I can scout a new path. Ah! Wait for me here.\\r\\n(Alyx climbs up a drain pipe to the top of a building)\\r\\nAlyx-Hey! Looks like we might be able to get through down there! Lets head\\r\\nthat way!\\r\\n(Bullets are fired at Alyx)\\r\\nAlyx-Ah! No! Gordon! Run! Get out of here!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon runs off into the sewers)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2l. Follow Freeman!\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(After getting through the sewers Gordon finds another resistance member)\\r\\nResistance 1-Dr. Freeman! Barney said you were on your way. We got split up by\\r\\nsnipers, and he is pinned down in a warehouse up ahead. Go ahead, he is\\r\\nrelying on you.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon heads past the snipers and finds a wounded resistance member in the\\r\\nbasement of the warehouse)\\r\\nResistance 2-Help! Is somebody up there? Help! Help me! We thought we would be\\r\\nsafer down here. Little did we know the place was infested. The rest of them\\r\\nheaded upstairs, took their chances with the snipers. I guess they are still\\r\\nup there.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon heads upstairs and sees Barney)\\r\\nBarney-Over here! Gordon I cant move, these snipers have got me pinned down.\\r\\nGordon lob a couple grenades, that will clear them out.\\r\\n(Gordon blows out the snipers with grenades)\\r\\nBarney-Alright, thanks Gordon, now lets clear out of here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon and Barney head out of the building and to a security gate)\\r\\nBarney-Let me get this gate. My Civil Protection status still gives me limited\\r\\nclearance. Did you hear a cat just now? That damn thing haunts me.\\r\\n(Barney opens the gate and they both continue on)\\r\\n\\r\\n(They come to a building and some resistance members join them)\\r\\nBarney-There is an old building up ahead. A bank or museum or something like\\r\\nthat. Whatever the hell it used to be, now it is a nexus for Overwatch in\\r\\nCity 17. It is the main source of pain for this part of town, thanks to a huge\\r\\nsuppression device that rains down hell from the roof of the place.\\r\\n(They come to a window)\\r\\nBarney-There it is, the Overwatch nexus. Looks like they are mobilizing \\r\\nbig-time. You can sort of see the gate from here. I will show you when we get\\r\\nto street level. We have to get into that building to open the gate. Even then\\r\\nthe suppression device will, suppress anyone who tries to come through unless\\r\\nwe shut it down.\\r\\n(As Gordon goes into the next room a camera detects him and an alarm goes off)\\r\\nBarney-So much for stealth. We have been spotted!\\r\\n(They reach the street)\\r\\nBarney-There is the gate I was telling you about. We have to come back here\\r\\nafter we get it open. If we get it open. First we gotta get into the nexus\\r\\nbuilding.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Barney and Gordon fight past the combine and get into the building)\\r\\nBarney-Uh-oh, turrets. You have the HEV suit, you deal with them. Then I will\\r\\nopen the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Barney and Gordon fight past the combine into the building and come to a room\\r\\nwith lasers)\\r\\nBarney-Wow, with that much security there must be something good in there.\\r\\nGo for it doc. I will wait here until you shut I down.\\r\\n(Gordon gets past the lasers and shuts it down)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After disabling the final generator Barney and Gordon head for the roof)\\r\\nBarney-Ah here it is, roof access. I am going to stay here and help other\\r\\nresistance members come through.\\r\\n\\r\\n(After fighting his way up to and down from the roof Gordon finds another\\r\\nresistance member)\\r\\nResistance 3-Dr. Freeman! Since you shut off the suppressor and opened the\\r\\ngate, we can really move people through now. The combine is really going to\\r\\nfeel the squeeze! We dropped a crate of rockets across the plaza. If you can\\r\\nmake it there you can take down the striders.\\r\\n\\r\\n(After fighting his way through City 17 and past a whole mess of striders\\r\\nGordon finds Dog bursting through a barricade of cars with Barney running\\r\\nbehind him)\\r\\nBarney-Dog! Here boy! Dog come back here! Damn it all! Gordon! Hey help me\\r\\nout here!\\r\\n(They run over to the citadel wall)\\r\\nBarney-Dog came crashing through the plaza, knocking over walls, I think he\\r\\nis looking for Alyx. He seems to have it set in his mind that she is in the\\r\\ncitadel. I figured Alyx would not want him getting into any deeper trouble but\\r\\nhell, you try stopping him.\\r\\n(Dog pulls  up the citadel wall)\\r\\nBarney-Hey dog! Not there! You cannot get through that way!\\r\\n(Dog lifts it all the way up)\\r\\nBarney-Well I will be dammed. I think he wants you to go through Gordon,\\r\\nyou had better hurry.\\r\\n(Gordon jumps into the hole)\\r\\nBarney-And if you see Dr. Breen, tell him I said f--- -ou!*\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon heads down into the citadel through the underground)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2m. Our Benefactors\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(Gordon rides along the prison pod conveyor system to get to the top of the \\r\\ncitadel, he gets the upgraded gravity gun and probably enjoys throwing some \\r\\ncombine fools around the building)\\r\\n\\r\\nNo dialogue in this level\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2n. Dark Energy\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(Gordon reaches the top of the citadel in the prison pod, the guards take the\\r\\nblue gravity gun from him and Judith comes in)\\r\\nJudith-I will take him from here. Dont struggle, its no use. Until you are\\r\\nwhere he wants you there is nothing you can do. I am sorry Gordon.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Judith leads the pod into a room with Eli and Dr. Breen talking)\\r\\nDr. Breen-..ancient stars colonized by sentient fungi. Gas giants, inhabited\\r\\nby vast meteorological intelligences. Worlds stretched thin across the\\r\\nmembranes where dimensions intersect...Impossible to describe with our limited\\r\\nvocabulary!\\r\\nEli-What I have seen is also beyond words Breen. Genocide, indescribable \\r\\nevil...Good god.\\r\\nDr. Breen-Well if it isnt Gordon Freeman at last.\\r\\n(The guard shows Breen the gravity gun)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Oh what is this? Put it over there.\\r\\n(The guard puts it on the desk)\\r\\nDr. Breen-You have my gratitude Dr. Freeman, first you lead me to the doorstep\\r\\nof my oldest friend, then you deliver yourself. If I had known you were going\\r\\nto come straight up to my office I would not have bothered hunting you in the\\r\\nfirst place. Having both of you in my keeping ensures I can dictate the terms\\r\\nof any bargain I care to make with the Combine.\\r\\nJudith-Dr. Breen..Wallace..\\r\\nDr. Breen-Yes what is it Judith?\\r\\nJudith-The bargain we should be making is for his life so he can continue his\\r\\nresearch!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Thanks to you we have everything we need in that regard. You are \\r\\nmore than qualified to finish his research yourself. What neither you nor I\\r\\ncan do is convince that rabble in the streets to give up their senseless \\r\\nstruggle. Yet Eli refuses to speak the words that would save them all.\\r\\nEli-Save them?! For what?!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Eli.. If you will not do this for the good of all people, maybe\\r\\nyou will do it for one of them.\\r\\n(The mechanical arm takes Alyx out of the prison pod)\\r\\nEli-Alyx..Honey..\\r\\nAlyx-Dad! Huh.. Gordon? No..\\r\\nEli-God damn you Breen! You let her go!\\r\\nDr. Breen-That is all up to you my old friend. Will you let your stubborn\\r\\nshort sightedness doom the entire species? Or will you give your child the\\r\\nchance her mother never had?\\r\\n(Alyx spits in his face)\\r\\nAlyx-How dare you even mention her!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Alyx my dear you have your mothers eyes. But your fathers\\r\\nstubbornness.\\r\\nAlyx-You have not seen a bit of it yet.\\r\\nDr. Breen-Really? Well lets see how it serves you, on the far side of a\\r\\ncombine portal.\\r\\nEli-Go ahead Breen! If that is the worst you can do, send us through your\\r\\nportal.\\r\\nDr. Breen-Oh it is hardly the worst. But you might find that hard to believe\\r\\nonce you get there.\\r\\nJudith-It isnt necessary!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I agree it is a total waste. Fortunately the resistance has shown\\r\\nit is willing to accept a new leader. And this one has proven to be a fine\\r\\npawn for those who control him.\\r\\nEli-No!\\r\\nAlyx-Dont listen to him Gordon!\\r\\nDr. Breen-How about it Dr. Freeman? Did you realize your contract was open to\\r\\nthe highest bidder?\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon would never make any kind of deal with you!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I understand if you dont wish to discuss this in front of your\\r\\nfriends. I will send them on their way and then we can talk openly.\\r\\nEli-Dont struggle honey.\\r\\nAlyx-Dad.. Im so sorry.\\r\\nEli-Alyx..sweetheart.\\r\\n(Judith uses the hacking tool on the console)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Judith, what do you think you are doing?\\r\\nJudith-We are doing what I could never do alone. We are stopping you.\\r\\nAlyx-Yes!\\r\\n(Breen uses the intercom)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Guards! Get in here!\\r\\n(Judith uses the hacking tool on the intercom, the guards begin banging on the\\r\\ndoor)\\r\\nDr. Breen-They know you betrayed them, they will turn on you, Judith..\\r\\nDr. Mossman please!\\r\\nJudith-I am sorry Wallace, you are all out of time.\\r\\n(Judith begins using the console, Breen tries to stop her)\\r\\nJudith-Dont!\\r\\n(As Judith is freeing Gordon Breen grabs the gravity gun)\\r\\nAlyx-Hurry! Dad hang on!\\r\\nDr. Breen-You fool!\\r\\nAlyx-Watch out he is gonna..\\r\\nDr. Breen-No!\\r\\n(Breen fires the gun, Gordon gets up and he is free)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad!\\r\\nEli-Oh no no no. Dont worry about me honey.\\r\\nJudith-There is no time Alyx, he is on his way to the portal. You will need\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n(Judith gives Alyx the hacking tool)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Mossman..Judith.. Look after my father.\\r\\nJudith-Dont you worry.\\r\\nAlyx-Dad I am not saying goodbye.\\r\\nEli-Never.\\r\\nAlyx-Come on Gordon, lets go.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx and Gordon get into the elevator)\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon.. We have not known each other very long, but I know you did not\\r\\nhave to do this. I had to rescue my father, but you.. well.. thanks for coming\\r\\nafter me.\\r\\nAlyx-Hey listen!\\r\\n(Breen is talking to someone)\\r\\nDr. Breen-It is me you should be concerned about, I can still deliver earth\\r\\nbut not without your help.\\r\\nAlyx-That is him!\\r\\nDr. Breen-The portal destination is untenable surely you can set the relay \\r\\ndestination elsewhere. There is no way I can survive in that environment.\\r\\nA host body? You must be joking, there is no way I can possibly..\\r\\nAlyx-There he is!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Oh alright dammit if that is what it takes. Just hurry! He is right\\r\\nbehind me!\\r\\n(Alyx uses the hacking tool on the force shield)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Oh shit!\\r\\n(Gordon picks up the gravity gun, and Breen gets into another elevator and\\r\\nshuts the door before he can get in)\\r\\nAlyx-Dammit! Not again! Huh! The gravity gun! He does not have a clue does he?\\r\\nI wonder where he is going.\\r\\n(The metal shield opens up to reveal the top of the citadel)\\r\\nAlyx-Oh my god! This is the dark fusion reactor. It powers their tunneling\\r\\nentanglement device. We will never have a chance like this again. We have to \\r\\nstop him!\\r\\n(Alyx uses the consoles)\\r\\nAlyx-I cannot shut it down, looks like he has turned control over to the other\\r\\nside. You will have to go into the core and do what you can. Get into the\\r\\nelevator and I will let you in. Do not forget to charge up your suit.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon gets into the elevator and Alyx lets him down into the core, he sees\\r\\nDr. Breen in the tower in the center inside a glowing orb, as he goes up the \\r\\nchamber Breen taunts him)\\r\\nAlyx-Its Dr. Breen! There he is!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Dr. Freeman, you really should not be out there. At the moment of \\r\\nsynapse as I teleport this chamber will be bathed in deadly particles that\\r\\nhave yet to be named by human science. Perhaps when I have the leisure to do\\r\\nthe work myself, I will name one after you. That way you will not be \\r\\ncompletely forgotten. When the singularity collapses, I will be far away from \\r\\nhere, in another universe in fact. You on the other hand will be destroyed in\\r\\nevery way possible, and even some essentially impossible.\\r\\nAlyx-What the hell? Oh no, combine soldiers, where did they come from?\\r\\nDr. Breen-I do not know what you can possibly hope to achieve, apart from your\\r\\nown annihilation.\\r\\nAlyx-Do not listen to him Gordon!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I warned you this was futile.\\r\\nAlyx-He is bluffing Gordon. Do not listen to him!\\r\\n(Gordon reaches the center)\\r\\nAlyx-Great! Oh no, Breen has started his ascent! Hurry Gordon before he\\r\\nescapes!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I could have told you that was pointless Dr. Freeman.\\r\\nAlyx-Go Gordon!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Are you still with us Dr. Freeman? Not for much longer I think.\\r\\n(Gordon reaches the top)\\r\\nAlyx-Oh my god, the portal is opening!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I hope you have said your farewells.\\r\\n(Gordon uses the gravity gun to shoot the energy balls into the portal)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Go back Freeman, you have no idea what you are doing!\\r\\n(Gordon continues to wreck the portal)\\r\\nDr. Breen-You do not know what you will unleash, you could bring down this\\r\\nwhole citadel. Think, man, think of the people below!\\r\\n(Gordon blows up the portal)\\r\\nDr. Breen-NO! You need me!\\r\\nAlyx-Yes!\\r\\n(The shield covering the control room shuts off and Alyx steps out)\\r\\nAlyx-Yeah! You did it! Come on Gordon we have got to get out of here, maybe\\r\\nwe still have...\\r\\n\\r\\n(The portal collapses and explodes, time begins to slow down and the Gman\\r\\nslowly appears)\\r\\nGman-Time? Dr. Freeman? Is it really that time again? It seems as if you only\\r\\njust arrived. You have done a great deal in a small timespan. You have done\\r\\nso well that I have received some interesting offers for your services. \\r\\nOrdinarily I would not contemplate them, but these are extraordinary times.\\r\\nRather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of\\r\\nchoosing for you. If and when the time comes again.\\r\\n(The background begins to fade away into black, a greenish light appears)\\r\\nGman-I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition,\\r\\nDr. Freeman, I trust it will all make sense in the course of.. well.. I am \\r\\nreally not at liberty to say.\\r\\n(The background becomes a black tunnel with white strands of light flying by)\\r\\nGman-In the meantime, this is where I get off.\\r\\n(A door slides open in the air and the Gman steps in and the door shuts behind\\r\\nhim and the credits roll)\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of game\\r\\n\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n3.

Notes\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1. Introduction\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHalf-Life 2, possibly the greatest PC game ever made in my opinion. \r\nHalf-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life (duh), in which Gordon Freeman (the \r\ncharacter you play as), has to fight his way out of the black mesa research \r\nfacility after a science experiment goes horribly wrong.  Half-Life 2 takes \r\nplace an unspecified amount of years after Half-Life. This FAQ will list in\r\ndetail the game script.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n2. Script\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe script I list will only be the scripted (no pun intended) parts of the \r\ngame, for example I wont list things that your squad mates say, like Here take \r\nthis medkit. I will separate different conversations with simple empty lines.\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2a. Point Insertion\r\n==============================================================================\r\nGman-Rise and shine Mr. Freeman, rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply that \r\nyou have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest than you.\r\nAnd all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until.... Well lets \r\njust say your hour has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make \r\nall the difference in the world. So wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the \r\nashes.\r\n(The gman slowly fades away into the background and his image is replaced with \r\nthe viewpoint of Gordon Freeman on a train pulling into a station)\r\n\r\nCitizen 1-I didnt see you get on.  This is my third transfer this year.\r\nCitizen 2-No matter how many times I get relocated I never get used to it.\r\n(the train pulls into the station and stops)\r\nCitizen 1-Well, end of the line.\r\n(as Gordon gets off the train he is scanned by a small flying device, a large \r\nmonitor with a face on it begins to speak)\r\n\r\nMonitor/Breen-Welcome, welcome to city 17, you have chosen or been chosen to \r\nrelocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.  I thought so much of \r\ncity 17 that I elected to establish my administration here, in the citadel so \r\nthoughtfully provided by our benefactors. I have been proud to call city 17 my \r\nhome. So whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts \r\nunkown, welcome to city 17, it is safer here.\r\n\r\nCivil Patrol-First warning move away.\r\nCitizen 3-It, Its all I have left.\r\n(the civil patrolman shoves the citizen into his luggage)\r\nCivil Patrol-Move it.\r\nCitizen 3-Alright, alright I am moving, jeez.\r\n\r\nCitizen 4-Were you the only ones on that train? Overwatch stopped our train in \r\nthe woods and took my husband for questioning.  They said he would be on the \r\nnext train, I am not sure when that was.  They are being nice and letting me \r\nwait though.\r\n\r\nCitizen 5-Dont drink the water, they, they put something in it to make you \r\nforget, I dont even remember how I got here.\r\n\r\nCitizen 6-Dr. Breen again? I was hoping I had seen the last of him in city 14.\r\nCitizen 7- I wouldnt say that to loud, this is his base of operations.\r\n\r\n(Gordon looks down to the end of the checkpoint where he sees citizens\r\nbeing led through)\r\nCivil Patrol 2-You, Citizen come with me.\r\nCitizen 8-Wai, Wait a minute where are you...\r\nCivil Patrol 2-GET IN HERE!\r\nCivil Patrol 2- Go on!\r\nCitizen 8-ME?\r\nCivil Patrol 2-I SAID MOVE!\r\n\r\n(Gordon comes to a fenced in area, a civil patrolman blocks his path, he goes \r\nthe other way and when he enters the caged area both doors shut and an alarm \r\nsounds, he is scanned by a camera)\r\n\r\nCivil Patrol 3-Dont move, hold it\r\n(the side door opens)\r\nCivil Patrol 4-You citizen, come with me.\r\n(Gordon follows him down a hallway, as he looks into a room he can see a \r\ncitizen being intterogated)\r\nCitizen 9-This must be a mistake, I got a standard relocation coupon just like \r\neveryone else.\r\n(before Gordon can see anything more the civil patrol man in this room shuts \r\nthe viewing slot on the door)\r\n\r\n(Gordon comes to the last door in the hall way, the civil patrolman knocks on \r\nthe door and it opens to reveal another civil patrolman)\r\nCivil Patrol 4-Get in! Need any help with this one?\r\nCivil Patrol 5-No I am good\r\n(Civil Patrolman 4 leaves the room)\r\nCivil Patrol 5-Back up!\r\nCivil Patrol 5-Yeah I am gonna need me some privacy for this\r\n(civil patrolman 5 uses his console to turn off the 2 cameras in the room)\r\nCivil Patrol 5-Now...\r\n(the civil patrolman takes off his helmet and reveals himself to be barney)\r\nBarney-About that beer I owed ya. Its me Gordon, barney from black mesa. \r\nSorry for the scare I had to put on a show for the cameras. I have been\r\nworking undercover with civil protection, I cant take too long or they will \r\nget suspicious, I am way behind on my beating quota\r\n(a man in a lab coat appears on the screen on the console in front of barney)\r\nDr. Kliener-Yes barney what is it? I am in the middle of a critical test.\r\nBarney-Sorry doc, but look whos here.\r\nDr. Kliener-Great Scott! Gordon Freeman! I expected more warning.\r\nBarney-Yeah you and me both doc. He was about to board the express train to \r\nNova Prospekt.\r\nDr. Kliener-Well, Barney what do you intend to do?\r\nBarney-Im thinking, Im thinking.\r\nDr. Kliener-Alyx is around here somewhere, she would have an idea of how to\r\nget him here.\r\nBarney-Well, as long as he stays away from checkpoints we should be okay.  \r\nListen I gotta go doc, we are taking enough chances as it is.\r\nDr. Kleiner-Very well. And eh Gordon? Its good to see you.\r\n(the monitor shuts off)\r\nBarney-Okay Gordon your going to have to make your way to Dr. Klieners lab.\r\n(there is a loud knocking at the door)\r\nBarney-Oh man! That is what I was afraid of! Get in here Gordon! Before you \r\nblow my cover!\r\n(barney releases the lock on the back door)\r\nBarney-Pile up some stuff to get to that window and keep going till your in\r\nthe plaza. I will meet up with you later.\r\n\r\n(Gordon escapes out the window and arrives at another building, a civil \r\npatrolman blocks his only path, he knocks a can over)\r\nCivil Patrol 6-Pick up that can. Now put it in the trash can.\r\n(reluctantly Gordon puts it in the trash can)\r\nCivil Patrol 6-Alright you can go.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Gordon comes to a large plaza, with gates branching to different areas of the \r\ncity, he continues past the plaza outside, beyond the plaza lies a extremely \r\nlarge building, he makes his way down the street to a area with 2 buildings,\r\none of the entrances is guarded by civil patrolman)\r\nCitizen 10-This is how it always starts, first one building, then the entire \r\nblock.\r\nCitizen 11-They have no reason to come to our place.\r\nCitizen 10-Dont worry, they will find one.\r\n(Gordon enters the entrance of the non-guarded building)\r\n\r\n(as he makes his way up the stairs he sees a group of 4 civil patrolmen knock \r\ndown a door and rush in too a room, he enters the adjacent room)\r\nCitizen 12-Oh, I thought you were a cop.\r\nCitizen 13-Dont worry he is one of us.\r\nCitizen 12-Look at them down there.\r\nCitizen 13-I told you they would be coming for us next!\r\nCitizen 12-Just this once I hope you are wrong.\r\n\r\n(as he makes his way further up the building a voice sounds)\r\nWarning Voice-Attention residents, miscount detected in your sector\r\nCitizen 14-Psst! Hey you! In here! Head for the roof! There is no time to lose!\r\nCitizen 15-Run for your life!\r\nCitizen 16-Civil Protection!\r\nCitizen 17-CPs!\r\nCitizen 16-Here they come!\r\n(Civil protection starts raiding the building and Gordon runs for the roof \r\nalong with other citizens)\r\n\r\nCitizen 18-Get in here quick!\r\n(the citizen shuts the door to the room and holds his body against it)\r\nCitizen 18-Head for the roof! I will keep them busy!\r\n(a chase ensues with Gordon running across a series of rooftops with civil \r\nprotection chasing him)\r\n\r\n(Gordon reaches a open window and goes inside, he heads down a staircase which \r\ncollapses behind him, civil protection close in on him)\r\nAlyx-Over Here! Ha! No you dont!\r\n(the screen goes white and Gordon is knocked unconscious)\r\n(as Gordon wakes up he sees alyx and the bodies of the CPs that were chasing \r\nhim)\r\nAlyx-Dr. Freeman I presume? We better hurry, the combine can be slow to wake, \r\nbut once they are up you will have a hard time taking them down.\r\n(alyx opens an elevator and Gordon heads down it along with her)\r\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener said you might be coming this way. I dont think it occurred to \r\nhim that you might not have a map.\r\nAlyx-Im Alyx Vance, my father worked with you back in black mesa, but im sure \r\nyou dont remember him.\r\nAlyx-Man of few words arent you?\r\nAlyx-Remember him from black mesa? Your old administrator?\r\n(alyx gestures to a picture of the same man that was on the large monitor)\r\nAylx-Ha! Dont get my dad started on Dr. Breen.\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2b. A Red Letter Day\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\nAylx-Funny you showing up on this day in particular.\r\nAylx-We have been helping people escape the city on foot. Its a dangerous route \r\nto my fathers lab through the old canals, today we are finally on the verge of \r\nhaving a better way.\r\nAlyx-Here lemme buy you a drink\r\n(alyx puts a coin into a vending machine, the machine opens like a door to \r\nreveal a passage behind it that leads to Dr. Klieners lab)\r\nAlyx-Oh and by the way, nice to finally meet you.\r\n\r\n(Gordon enters the lab and sees Dr. Kliener)\r\nDr. Kliener-Blast that little.. where did she get to? Llamar? Come out of there.\r\nAylx-Uh-oh, everything alright Dr. Kliener?\r\nDr. Kliener-Oh, hello Alyx. Well almost alright, Llamar has gotten out of her \r\ncrate again. If I didnt know better, I would suspect barney of trapping and..\r\nMy goodness, Gordon Freeman, It really is you isnt it?\r\nAlyx-I found him wandering around outside, bit of a troublemaker isnt he?\r\nDr. Kliener-We owe a great deal to Dr. Freeman, even if trouble does seem to \r\nfollow in his wake.\r\nDr. Kliener-I must say Gordon you have come at a very opportune time, Alyx has \r\njust installed the final piece in the resurrected teleport!\r\nAlyx-I cant take any credit for the breakthrough doctor.\r\nDr. Kliener-Nonsense, your talents surpass your loveliness.\r\nAylx-Lets just see if this thing works ok?\r\n\r\n(barney enters the lab)\r\nBarney-Well is he here? There you are! Man Gordon you stirred up the hive!\r\nBarney-We cant keep him here long doc, It will jeporadize everything we have \r\nworked for.\r\nAlyx-Dont worry he is coming with me.\r\nDr. Kliener-Thats right Barney, this is a red letter day, we will inaugurate \r\nthe new teleport with a double transmission.\r\nBarney-You mean its working? For real this time? Because I still have \r\nnightmares about that cat.\r\nAlyx-What cat?\r\nDr. Kliener-Now now there is nothing to be worried about, we have made major \r\nstrides since then. Major strides.\r\nAylx-What cat?\r\nBarney-Doc, since he is not taking the streets you might as well get him out\r\nof his civvies.\r\nDr. Kliener-What? Oh dear you are right, I almost forgot. Barney I will give \r\nyou the honor.\r\nBarney-I have gotta get back on my shift but ok.\r\n\r\n(barney uses a keypad to open up a garage like door, inside this small room \r\nthere is a glass case which contains the HEV suit)\r\nBarney-Here we go.. Awahh!\r\n(Dr. Klieners pet headcrab Llamar jumps on barney)\r\nBarney-Damn it! Get it off me!\r\nDr. Kliener-Llamar! There you are!\r\nBarney-I though you got rid of that pest!\r\nDr. Kliener-Certainly not. Never fear Gordon, she is de-beaked and completely \r\nharmless. The worst she might try to do is couple with your head. Fruitlessly.\r\nLlamar-Guwakkh!\r\nBarney-Get that thing away from me!\r\nDr. Kliener-Here my pet. Hop up!\r\n(Llamar jumps up onto a shelf with some crates and computers)\r\nDr. Kliener-No not up there!\r\nDr. Kliener-No, No! Careful Llamar those are quite fragile.\r\n(Llamar jumps into a vent)\r\nDr. Kliener-Oh fie! It will be another week before I can coax here out of \r\nthere!\r\nBarney-Yeah. Longer if we are lucky.\r\nAlyx-Barney.. You are not an animal person?\r\nBarney-Ugh.\r\nDr. Kliener-Well Gordon go ahead, slip into your suit now.\r\n\r\n(Gordon steps into the glass chamber and puts the HEV suit on)\r\nDr. Kliener-Well Gordon I see your HEV suit still fits you like a glove, at \r\nleast the glove parts do.\r\nDr. Kliener-I have made a few modifications, but I will just acquaint you with \r\nthe essentials, now lets see..\r\n(Dr. Kliener picks up a clipboard with a paper on it and begins reading from \r\nthe paper)\r\nDr. Kliener-The Mark V Hazardous Environment Suit has been redesigned for \r\ncomfort and utility..\r\n\r\n(A loud alarm sounds in the background)\r\nDr. Kliener-Oh dear!\r\nBarney-Doc we dont have time for this. At least get that suit juiced up Gordon.\r\nDr. Kliener-Good idea, there is a charger on the wall. I have modified your \r\nsuit to draw power from combine energy outlets, which are plentiful wherever \r\nthey patrol.\r\nAylx-Meanwhile, lets get this show on the road.\r\n\r\n(Dr. Kliener moves a picture frame around, this opens up a retinal scanner \r\nwhich he uses to open up a secret room behind the wall, Gordon enters the room \r\nalong with everyone else, inside is a large mass of computers and wires along \r\nwith a platform in the middle of the room, Alyx gets onto the platform and the \r\nguard rails close behind her)\r\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, why dont you position yourself near the panel over there \r\nand wait for my word?\r\n\r\n(A man appears on a monitor behind barney)\r\nEli-Issac are you there?\r\nDr. Kiener-Yes, yes, Eli, a bit of a hold up on this end. You will never \r\nguess who found his way into our lab this morning.\r\nEli-Thats not who I think it is, is it?\r\nDr. Kliener-Indeed it is, and its our intention to send him packing straight \r\naway, in the company of your lovely daughter.\r\nAylx-Are you ready for us dad?\r\nEli-We are all set on this end.\r\nAylx-Then lets do it\r\n(the platform Alyx is standing on begins to rise)\r\nDr. Kliener-Lets see, the massless field flux should self-limit and I have \r\nclamped the manifold parameters to include CY Hilbert and GC orbitfold \r\ninclusive. Conditions could not be more ideal.\r\nBarney-Thats what you said last time.\r\nAylx-Hey, uh, yeah, about that cat..\r\nDr. Kliener-Initializing in three.. two.. one.. Oh fiddlesticks what now?\r\n(One of the plugs comes lose out of its outlet)\r\nAylx-Uh, doctor the plug.\r\nDr. Kliener-Dear me, you are right, Gordon would you mind plugging us in.\r\n(Gordon plugs the cord back in)\r\nAlyx-You gonna let Gordon throw the switch?\r\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, go right ahead.\r\n(Gordon throws the switch)\r\nDr. Kliener-Very good, final sequence commencing..now.\r\nBarney-I cant look.\r\nAlyx-Uh, ok, oh ah ohhh!\r\n\r\n(Aylx disappears from the teleporter)\r\nDr. Kliener-Well, did it work?\r\nEli-See for yourself\r\nAylx-Hey doc!\r\nDr. Kliener-Thank goodness, my relief is almost palpable\r\nEli-Fantastic work Izzy\r\nDr. Kliener-Well I cant take all the credit, Dr. Freeman proved an able \r\nassistant\r\nEli-Lets go ahead and bring Gordon through now.\r\nDr. Kliener-Right you are, speak to you again in a few moments.\r\nBarney-Good job Gordon, throwing that switch and all, I can see your M.I.T.\r\neducation really pays off.\r\nDr. Kliener-Alright Barney, your turn.\r\nBarney-Gee thanks\r\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, as soon as you are in position we will send you to Eli.\r\n(The loud alarm sounds again)\r\nBarney-And not a moment too soon\r\n(Gordon steps into the teleporter, the guardrails close and it begins to rise)\r\nDr. Kliener-Excellent, initializing, in three.. two.. one.., eh Barney if you \r\nwould be so kind?\r\nBarney-Good luck out there Gordon\r\nDr. Kliener-Yes indeed, we are ready to project you Gordon, best of luck in \r\nyour future endeavors, and bon voyage, final sequence.\r\n\r\n(An alarm begins to sound)\r\nBarney-What the hell?\r\n(Llamar jumps out of a vent a breaks some wires connected to the teleporter)\r\nDr. Kliener-What is it?\r\nBarney-Its your pet the freaking head humper!\r\nDr. Kliener-Llamar? Hedy! No!\r\nBarney-Look out!\r\n(Llamar jumps onto the teleport as it begins to malfunction, Gordon is \r\ntransported to a beach, then back to the lab)\r\nBarney-There he is!\r\nDr. Kliener-Is Llamar with him?\r\nBarney-Forget about that thing!\r\n(Gordon is now transported to his intended destination)\r\nAlyx-He is coming through dad!\r\nEli-What is going on Judith?\r\nJudith-Im not sure, it seems to be some kind of interference.\r\nEli-Gordon stay put we will get ya out of there.\r\nJudith-Something is drawing him away.\r\n(Gordon is teleported into an unknown location, he sees the same man he saw on \r\nthe monitor)\r\nBreen-What is the meaning of this? Who are you? How did you get in here?\r\n(Gordon is now teleported back to the lab)\r\nBarney-He is back, Im getting him outta there.\r\nDr. Kliener-You cant just wade into the field! It will peel you apart!\r\nAlyx-We just lost Gordon what is going on?\r\nDr. Kliener-I wish I knew, Im encountering unexpected interference\r\nBarney-Dont worry Gordon we will..\r\n(Gordon is transported back to his original destination)\r\nAylx-There he is!\r\nJudith-Ah! We are losing him again!\r\n(Gordon is transported back to the unknown location)\r\nBreen-The man I saw, im all but certaint it was... Gordon Freeman\r\n(Gordon is transported underwater, A giant alien comes rushing at him but he \r\nis transported again at the last second, this time he is outside of the lab\r\nlooking in through a window behind Dr. Kliener)\r\nDr. Kliener-What do you mean he is not there?\r\nEli-He didnt come through.\r\nDr. Kliener-Then where is he?\r\nEli-Behind you.\r\nDr. Kliener-Ahh!\r\nEli-Shut it down! Shut it down!\r\nDr. Kliener-Gordon run! You must get out of here!\r\nBarney-Get down outta sight I will come find you!\r\n\r\n(Gordon makes his way through the area behind the lab until he sees barney on a \r\nledge above)\r\nBarney-Gordon! I have never seen the citadel on full alert like that! Take the \r\nold canals out of city 17 to Eli, its dangerous but there is a whole network\r\nof resistance members who run the underground railroad. I would come with you \r\nbut I have to look after Dr. Kliener. Oh and before I forget, I think you \r\ndropped this back at black mesa.\r\n(Barney throws down a crowbar)\r\nBarney-Good luck out there buddy, you are gonna need it.\r\n(Gordon makes his way away from the lab and through a train station while \r\nbeing chased by civil protection)\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2c. Route Kanal\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\n(Gordon makes his way through the sewers of city 17 while being chased by civil \r\nprotection, as he rounds a corner he comes upon the scene of yet another\r\ncombine beating)\r\n\r\nCitizen 1-Help me! Stop we didnt do anything!\r\n(The combine soldiers are beating the husband of the woman, they notice\r\nfreeman and come after him instead, he kills them with his crowbar)\r\nCitizen 1-They will be looking for you now. You should run there is nothing\r\nelse you can do here.\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues his trek through the sewers while fighting civil protection, \r\nafter passing over same train tracks Gordon finds a citizen and a vorigaunt)\r\nCitizen 2-Good god! Guess those sirens are for you huh? Good thing you found \r\nus, you are not the first to come through by a..\r\nVorigaunt-This is the freeman, the reckoning of the combine has come.\r\nCitizen 2-Look we are just a lookout for the underground railroad. Main \r\nstation is right around the corner. They will get you started on the right \r\nfoot. Meanwhile let my vorigaunt friend here give you a jolt to get going.\r\n(The vorigaunt charges up the HEV suit)\r\nVorigaunt-That is all we can spare.\r\nCitizen 2-Be careful now, we REALLY cant afford to get noticed.  Civil \r\nprotection catches you down here, its bad news for the whole railroad.\r\nVorigaunt-We serve the same mystery.\r\nCitizen 2-Get outta here.\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues to find his way through the sewers and slums of city 17, he \r\ncomes upon a combine soldier killing a resistance member)\r\nCitizen 3-Wait. what are you.. no.. please.. dont shoot! Ahhh!\r\n(The radio in the underground railroad station is going)\r\nWoman on radio-Station 12 come in. Station 12 do you read?\r\nMan on radio-This is station 8! We heard 12 go down and out! Surgical strike \r\nunits are targeting the railway stations! Repeat Civil Protection is coming\r\ndown on the stations! We are already getting refuges from 9 and outlying,\r\nlooks like..(static)\r\nWoman on radio-Station 8 do you copy? Station 8 are you there? We have\r\nconfirmed reports of manhacks. Repeat they are filling the underground with \r\nmanhacks.\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues to battle the combine and go through the sewers, he comes\r\nupon a resistance member hiding in a piece of concrete pipe)\r\nCitizen 4-Over here! Keep going friend that station was raided but there are \r\nstill others up ahead. I am gonna stay here in case any others come through.  \r\nGotta keep the railway alive.\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues to press on through the sewers, he finds a combine patrol \r\nstanding on a grate above him)\r\nCivil Patrol 1-Anyone else get a 647-E reading?\r\nCivil Patrol 2-Check for miscount.\r\nCivil Patrol 1-Still getting that 647-E reading.\r\n(They see Gordon)\r\nCivil Patrol 3-There he is!\r\n\r\n(Gordon escapes through the sewer tunnel and heads on, he comes across another \r\nresistance station)\r\nCitizen 5-Get in here, hurry! Civil protection is on to us. We are tearing up \r\nthe railroad, covering up our tracks. Looks like you are going to be the last \r\none through. Be glad you are not the guy they are looking for. Poor bastard \r\ndoes not stand a chance. Sounds like they are calling in every CP unit in \r\ncity 17. Now they are flooding the areas up ahead with manhacks. You better \r\nget going before they sweep through here\r\n(The citizen opens the viewing slot on the door and is greeted with the site\r\nof several manhacks flying towards him)\r\nCitizen 5-Oh shit!\r\n(The citizen grabs a pipe and tries to defend himself, Gordon and the citizen \r\ndestroy all the manhacks)\r\nCitizen 5-Thanks for your help.  Look it isnt safe here, I will give you some \r\nsupplies to get you going but then you have to leave.  Good luck out there!\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues to press on into the sewers, he comes to another resistance \r\nstation)\r\nCitizen 6-Hey! You are Freeman arent you? We got word that you were coming.\r\nYou got here at a bad time.\r\n(A voice comes over the radio)\r\nAylx-Black Mesa East to station 6 do you read? Dr. Freeman is on his way \r\ndownriver. Lend him the airboat and give him all the help you can. Repeat \r\nGordon Freeman has returned, it is critical he reaches Black Mesa East.\r\nCitizen 6-You better get going now.\r\n\r\n(Gordon freeman heads on past the station, the area up ahead is being hit with \r\nartillery shells filled with headcrabs, he reached a small shelter with a \r\nairboat and another citizen)\r\nCitizen 7-Hey, Dr. Freeman I had been hoping you would show up, got this\r\nairboat all gassed up and ready to go. Its gonna be tough dodging civil \r\nprotection out there in the open, but drive hard and you will make it. You will \r\nfind more help at station 7, just up the river, its the red barn. Climb on in, \r\nand fire her up. You had better get going now!\r\n(Gordon drives the airboat out of the shelter and out of city 17 and into the \r\nriver)\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2d. Water Hazard\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues his way down the river and he comes upon a citizen on a \r\nbridge above him)\r\nCitizen 1-Hey! You down there! Supplies!\r\n(The citizen throws down some supply crates)\r\nCitizen 1-Look out below!\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues on, he reaches a closed floodgate, he goes inside the\r\nbuilding and inside he sees Dr. Breen on a monitor)\r\nDr. Breen-We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who \r\nhas acquired an almost meesianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens.\r\nHis figure is synonymous with the darkest urges of instinct, ignorance, and \r\ndecay. Some of the worst excesses of the Black Mesa incident have been laid \r\ndirectly at his feet. And yet unsophisticated minds continue to imbue him with \r\nromantic power. Giving him such labels as, the one free man, or the opener of \r\nthe way. Let me remind all citizens of the dangers of magical thinking.  \r\nWe have scarcely begun to climb from the dark pit of our the evolution of our \r\nspecies.  Let us not slide backward into oblivion, just as we have finally \r\nbegun to see the light. If you see this so called free-man, report him.\r\nCivic deeds do not go un-rewarded and likewise complicity with his cause will \r\nnot go un-punished. Be wise. Be safe. Be aware.\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues on and opens the flood gate, and passes further down the \r\nriver, after eluding a chopper, he comes upon a resistance outpost with two \r\ncitizens and a vorigaunt.)\r\nCitizen 2-Hey! You are freeman arent you?\r\nCitizen 3-Well! I wouldnt believe it if I couldnt see it with my own eyes. \r\nDr. Gordon Freeman himself!\r\nCitizen 2-You are just in time doc, we have gotta move out before the combine \r\npicks us up, we are getting ready to pull out.\r\nCitizen 3-We better hurry, we have to tear down this camp before the combine \r\ngets here.\r\nVorigaunt-Greetings to the Freeman.\r\nCitizen 3-Come on in, I will show you what you are up against.\r\n(The citizen leads Gordon into a room with a map and radio)\r\n Citizen 3-Here take a look at this. This here is the dam just up ahead.\r\n(The citizen points to the map)\r\nCitizen 3-The hideout is here, a stones throw away from the apron and nestled\r\nin the old hydro plant. But getting there, with that hunter chopper on\r\nyour ass, next to impossible.  Good news is, the vorigaunt is working his magic \r\non your airboat, so you will have a little more firepower going forward. I \r\nthink he is just finishing up now. Go on out.\r\n(Gordon goes back to the dock and checks on the airboat, it now has a gun \r\nmounted on it)\r\nCitizen 3-There we are. That gun came off of one of the same hunter choppers \r\nthat you are up against. I always like to bring a little irony to a firefight.\r\nVoriagunt-The freeman will accept this weapon, or suffer greatly on the road \r\nahead.\r\nCitizen 3-Farwell Dr. Freeman.\r\nVorigaunt-For Freedom!\r\nCitizen 2-Give them hell doc.\r\n\r\n(Gordon leaves the outpost, just as he gets to the hideout the flood gate \r\ncloses and he has to shoot down the chopper)\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2e. Black Mesa East\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\n(Gordon passes through the dam and finally reaches the hideout, he enters a \r\nchamber but it is sealed and some alarms go off)\r\nJudith-We have got something. Okay, its human. Hello? Take it easy in there \r\nyou are safe now.  You will have to forgive the scanning process we cant \r\ntake any chances.\r\n(Some machines begin to run a series of scans on Gordon)\r\nJudith-Dr. Freeman? Gordon Freeman?! Is that you? You made it here this \r\nquickly? Well is Eli is going to be amazed, not to mention relieved. \r\nI am Dr. Mossman, Dr. Judith Mossman. I have been hearing about you since long \r\nbefore the Black Mesa incident. Oh! Black Mesa. I do so envy you working with \r\nEli and Dr. Kliener when they were at the top of their field. Ah! There we go \r\nyou can come through now.\r\n(The scanners stop and turn off and the door in front of Gordon opens)\r\n\r\nJudith-I will take you down to Eli right away. He would never forgive me if I \r\nkept you waiting.\r\n(Judith leads Gordon down through the facility)\r\nJudith-We could certainly use the extra help around here. We have covered a \r\nlot of ground in the last few months, but things would go much more faster if \r\nwe had more people with your training. We are closing in on a reliable local\r\nteleport technology, something even the combine has not mastered. Eli thinks \r\ntheir portals are string based, similar to our Calabi-Yau model, but they have \r\nfailed to factor in the dark energy equations. They can tunnel through from \r\ntheir universe, but once they are here they are dependent on local \r\ntransportation. If they knew what we were doing with entanglement...\r\n(Judith gets into an elevator and Gordon follows)\r\nJudith-Oh listen to me, I sound like a post-doc. I am just so excited to think\r\nthat we will finally get the chance to work together.\r\n(The elevator goes down)\r\nJudith-Were was I? Oh yes, Dr. Kliener compressed the xen relay far beyond \r\nanything he imagined at Black Mesa. We figured out how to use xen as an \r\nunexpressed axis, effectively a dimensional slingshot so we can swing around \r\nthe borderworld and come back in local space without having to pass through.\r\n\r\n(The elevator reaches the bottom floor)\r\nJudith-Oh! Here is Eli now.\r\n(Eli is speaking to a vorigaunt)\r\nEli-Alright good you keep right on it.\r\nJudith-Eli! Look who I found in the airlock.\r\nEli-Gordon Freeman! Let me get a look at you man! My god man you havent\r\nchanged one iota. How do you do it? Now lets see the last time I saw you,\r\nI sent you up for help after the resonance cascade. I never thought it\r\nwould take you this long to get back to me. Welcome to the lab anyway,\r\nits not Black Mesa but it serves us well enough.\r\nJudith-Its going to be a lot more like Black Mesa with Gordon here to help.\r\nEli-Right you are, M.I.T. graduates are few and far between these days. \r\nWe will get you out of that hazard suit and back into your lab coat where you\r\nbelong.\r\nJudith-Lemme just finish up some work and I will see what I can dig up.\r\nDr. Freeman? It has been a real honor. I am looking forward to working \r\ntogether.\r\nEli-Feel free to look around.\r\n\r\n(Eli goes back to his business, after a short while Alyx walks in)\r\nAlyx-Ah! Gordon, the vorigaunts said you were here. I cannot believe\r\nyou made it so quickly on foot.\r\nEli-I believe he broke your record honey.\r\nAlyx-Well he earned it. I guess you proved you can handle yourself out there.\r\nEli-There is nothing Gordon cannot handle..with the possible exception of you.\r\nAlyx-Dad!\r\nEli-Haaaa\r\n\r\n(Alyx goes and works on one of the machines while Eli activates a display\r\nfor Gordon to look at)\r\nEli-Take a look at this Gordon.\r\n\r\n(Judith comes out of the room she was working in)\r\nJudith-Alyx I though you were on watch?\r\nAlyx-The vorigaunts relieved me show I could come see Gordon. \r\nAnyway I should be in here working on the portal.\r\nJudith-I have the repairs well in hand. Someone misjudged the capacity\r\nof the combine thyristor..\r\nAlyx-Are you blaming me?\r\nJudith-No it was a calculation error not a mechanical problem.\r\nAlyx-Then maybe you should let me do the calculations next time, as well as\r\nthe installing.\r\nJudith-Alyx really, sometimes I think you deliberately misunderstand me.\r\nEli-Ahem. Alyx why dont you take Gordon and show him the gravity gun.\r\nAlyx-Sure, come on Gordon, lets go have some fun.\r\nJudith-The zero point field energy manipulator is not a toy Alyx\r\nAylx-Lets get out of here.\r\n\r\n(Alyx opens up a door with keypad and leads Gordon down a hallway)\r\nAylx-So I seen you met Dr. Mossman, she is one of the main reasons\r\nI spend so much time outside. You should hear her drone on about how it\r\nshould have been her in the Black Mesa test chamber that day. I am sorry\r\nI shouldnt be talking behind her back, it just gets a bit cluastraphobic\r\ndown here.\r\n(Alyx points down a hallway)\r\nAlyx-Thats the old passage to Ravenholm. We dont go there anymore.\r\nCome on.\r\n\r\n(Alyx leads Gordon through another airlock into an area outside)\r\nAlyx-So here we are, the scrapyard. This is the gravity gun my father was \r\ntalking about, you can call it the zero point energy field manipulator if you \r\nreally want to.\r\n(Alyx opens a glass case and hands Gordon the gravity gun)\r\nAlyx-Its designed for handling hazardous materials, but we mainly use it for\r\nheavy lifting. Give it a try. The primary trigger emits a charge, you can punt\r\nstuff and send it flying. I found it handy for clearing minefields. The \r\nsecondary trigger lets you grab things, you can send them flying with the \r\nprimary. Once you have picked something up, you can drop it gently by pressing\r\nyour secondary trigger again. Pick up some stuff and toss it. You can also \r\npull stuff over from a distance. Try grabbing those barrels from that ledge up \r\nthere. All right.\r\n\r\n(Alyx leads Gordon into the scrapyard)\r\nAlyx-Now let me call dog, he loves to play fetch. \r\nDog! Come!\r\n(A large robot comes out of a metal shack on the other side of the scrapyard)\r\nAlyx-Gordon this is dog, my dad built him to protect me when I was a kid. \r\nFirst model way about yay-high I have been adding to him ever since.\r\nOk dog lets play catch with Gordon. You will need to use the gravity gun.\r\nGo ahead dog. Throw!\r\n\r\n(Dog throws a series of crates as Gordon catches them with the gravity gun)\r\nAlyx-Dog, go get your ball!\r\n(Dog runs over to a metal crate and removes a round glowing object, he throws \r\nthis object back and forth with Gordon)\r\nAlyx-When I told you that you would be playing fetch, I didnt tell you who \r\nwould be fetching did I.\r\n(This continues for a short while)\r\nAlyx-Ok Gordon lets try something else. Throw something bigger dog.\r\n(Dog runs over and picks up a dumpster)\r\nAlyx-No Dog! No boy put that down! What is it dog?\r\n(A explosion can be heard)\r\nAlyx-Oh my god what was that? Scanners! The combine is sweeping the area!\r\nWe have to head back to the lab come on Gordon!\r\n\r\n(Gordon follows Alyx back to the airlock along with dog, Alyx contacts Eli \r\nover the monitor)\r\nAlyx-Dad its Alyx are you there?\r\nEli-Alyx.. Honey\r\nAylx-Whats going on in there?\r\nEli-Where are you Alyx?\r\nAlyx-We are in the scrapyard airlock stuck in a full autocycle.\r\nEli-Is Gordon still with you?\r\nAlyx-He is right here.\r\nEli-Good, I want you two to..\r\n(The power shuts off)\r\nAlyx-Dad?\r\n(The power comes back on)\r\nEli-Take Gordon out of here, head for the coast! Do not go through raven..\r\n(The monitor cuts off)\r\nAlyx-Dad? Dad! Damn it! Dog open the airlock get us out of here! Hurry now!\r\nTear it apart if you have to, just get it open! Thats enough dog. Come on\r\nGordon! Come on!\r\n\r\n(As Alyx and Gordon run back to the lab a pile of rocks collapses separating\r\nGordon from Alyx, a firefight can be heard taking place, she speaks to him \r\nthrough a hole in the rubble)\r\nAlyx-Gordon you need to get out of here, I cant leave my father. Dog, take \r\nGordon to the Ravenholm tunnel, then circle around and try to meet up with me.\r\n\r\n(Gordon follows dog down the hallway Alyx pointed out earlier, Dog opens up\r\na tunnel door and Gordon continues on alone)\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2f. We Dont Go To Ravenholm\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\n(Gordon fights his way through Ravenholm, a horrid abandoned town infested \r\nwith headcrabs and zombies, after a short while he hears a mans voice)\r\nFather Gregori-For it was said that they had become like those peculiar demons\r\nwhich dwell in matter, but in which no light may be found.\r\nFather Gregori-For the days of my life have vanished like smoke, and my bones\r\nare parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as fuel for that fire\r\nuntil nothing remains but the light alone.\r\nFather Gregori-May they become like dust before the wind, may the angel of \r\nthe lord pursue them.\r\n\r\n(Gordon comes upon a burning yard with several zombies coming at him on fire,\r\na man kicks open the door at the top of the yard and kills the zombies with \r\na shotgun)\r\nFather Gregori-But whos is this? Another life to save? I will keep my eye on\r\nyou, more than that I cannot promise.\r\n(The man heads back into the door)\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues to fight his way through Ravenholm when he sees the man \r\nagain)\r\nFather Gregori-Well done brother. Make free us of my traps. But take care\r\nnot to fall in them yourself. Behind you!\r\n(Father Gregori shoots a zombie behind Gordon)\r\nFather Gregori-In Ravenholm, you do well to be vigilant.\r\n(Father Gregori walks away and Gordon continues to move forward)\r\n\r\n(After a short time Gordon sees him again)\r\nFather Gregori-Better and Better! I am Father Gregori, you have already met \r\nmy, congregation, aha aha ahaaa!\r\n(Father Gregori walks away again and Gordon moves on)\r\n\r\n(After some time Gordon again sees Father Gregori shooting at some zombies)\r\nFather Gregori-Ah! It is you brother! I apologize, but no harm done. My \r\nbullets are the least of your concerns.\r\n\r\n(In the same area Gordon sees him again)\r\nFather Gregori-Although they call me crazy I care not, for thou art my helper\r\nmy strength, and my savior.\r\n\r\n(Gordon sees the man soon again on a ledge above him)\r\nFather Gregori-Here brother! Come closer. You have stirred up hell!\r\nA man after my own heart! Here I have a more suitable gun for you. You will\r\nneed it. Catch!\r\n(Father Gregori throws Gordon a shotgun)\r\nFather Gregori-Good, now keep it close. My advice to you is..aim for the head.\r\nHush!\r\n(The sound of claws clinking on metal can be heard, the drain pipe in front of\r\nGordon begins to shake)\r\nFather Gregori-They come! There is no rest in Ravenholm! Move on and I will\r\nmeet you at the church.\r\n\r\n(After Gordon and Father Gregori fight off the aliens, Gordon moves on\r\nand sees him again)\r\nFather Gregori-How came you here brother? This is the wrong side of town\r\nfor you! Did I not tell you to seek the church? Mend your ways before it is\r\ntoo late!\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues on, as he emerges from a roof hatch he sees Father Gregori\r\non the other side of a fence, behind him is the church)\r\nFather Gregori-Ah, there you are! At last! I will send the cart for you\r\nbrother! It will be but a moment! Patience brother! Guard yourself well!\r\n(Father Gregori goes and activates the tiny gondola to the church, while\r\nGordon is waiting for it to arrive a swarm of aliens attacks him)\r\nFather Gregori-Almost there brother!\r\n(The gondola arrives)\r\nFather Gregori-Now brother step into the cart! The handbrake brother release \r\nit and come down!\r\n(Gordon rides the gondola across the fence and into the church area)\r\nFather Gregori-Greetings brother! And so we meet at last. You are to be\r\ncommended for avoiding my traps. The work of a man who once had too much time\r\non his hands, and now finds time for nothing but the work of salvation.\r\nI suspect you have little wish to remain in Ravenholm, so I will show you to\r\nthe mines. As for me..A shepherd must tend to his flock... Especially when\r\nthey have grown unruly. Follow me brother, and tread lightly, for this is\r\nhallowed ground.\r\n\r\n(Gordon and Father Gregori fight their way past the area behind the church,\r\nand past a graveyard to the mine entrance)\r\nFather Gregori-Farwell brother! I fear I deliver you to a darker place.\r\nMay the light of lights be with you. Look to your own, salvation.\r\n\r\n(Father Gregori runs off to kill some zombies, and Gordon heads into the \r\nmines, Gordon finally makes his way out of the mines, and emerges onto some\r\ntrain tracks, there are combine snipers here, after killing them he finds a\r\nfirefight going on between resistance members and the combine, he jumps in\r\nand helps, after this is over the citizens survey the damage)\r\n\r\nCitizen 1-Who is hurt?\r\nCitizen 2-Winston has been hit.\r\nCitizen 1-Patch him up and get him to the back as soon as he is stable.\r\n(He notices Gordon)\r\nCitizen 1-Gordon Freeman? Its incredible you made it! We have been getting\r\ncommunications from Alyx. I will see if I can reach her again. Follow me.\r\n(He leads Gordon to a door, then knocks on it)\r\nCitizen 1-Its Leon, we are all clear. And I have got Gordon Freeman!\r\n(The door opens)\r\nCitizen 3-Dr. Freeman you are kidding? I have been on the line with Alyx.\r\nHer father has been captured.\r\nCitizen 1-Over here Dr. Freeman.\r\nVorigaunt-The Eli Vance is indispensable to the liberation.\r\n(The citizen leads Gordon to a monitor, he tunes it and Alyx appears)\r\nCitizen 1-Alyx its Leon, and I have got Gordon Freeman with me.\r\nAlyx-Gordon! You made it through Ravenholm? Thank god! I need your help!\r\nThey have taken my father! He has been taken to Nova Prospekt. The vorigaunts\r\ntracked the ship that made off with him and Judith Mossman. While the trains\r\nare still running I am going to hitch a ride. Here is where you come in\r\nGordon. I need you to make your way along the coast until you get to\r\nNova Prospekt. It used to be a high security prison, its something much\r\nworse than that now. But I think it is still easier to sneak in than to\r\nbreak out.\r\nCitizen 1-You want him to take the coast road? He wont last five minutes on\r\nfoot. Its antlion spawning season.\r\nAlyx-Thats why I called you Leon. I was hoping you still had the scout car we\r\nleft with you last summer. The one my dad rigged with the tau cannon.\r\nCitizen 1-Yeah good idea, hold on a sec.\r\n(The citizen tunes the radio again)\r\nCitizen 1-Noriko? Bring the buggy out put it on the dock right now, Gordon\r\nFreeman will be driving it!\r\nCitizen on radio-Will do! I just finished mounting an ammo crate on the back.\r\nCitizen 1-Good timing. Ok Alyx we are all set.\r\nAlyx-Thanks Leon. Gordon I have not driven the coast in over a year, but I\r\nhave no reason to think its gotten any safer. Meet me in the depot where the\r\ntrains unload. Take care of yourself and I will see you in Nova Prospekt.\r\nCitizen 1-Bye Alyx. Ok doc, before you hit the road you might wanna grab some\r\nmedkits, restock on ammo, maybe check the map see where you are headed. There\r\nis an ammo supply crate on the back of the car if that is any comfort. Stay\r\nwith the car, make use of the thumpers, and you will stand a fair chance\r\nagainst the antlions. I will radio ahead to let the next base know you are\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n(Gordon heads out to the dock where the car is waiting)\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2g. Highway 17\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\n(As Gordon comes out onto the dock he can see the car waiting for him,\r\nand a large crane with a magnet on it)\r\n\r\nCitizen in crane-Hello Dr. Freeman, the car is all ready for you. Hop in and\r\nI will lower you down to the beach! Good here we go!\r\n(The citizen in the crane begins to lower Gordon and the car down to the\r\nbeach)\r\nCitizen in crane-Damn magnet is failing! Hold on!\r\n(The car falls to the beach upside down)\r\nCitizen in crane-Sorry doc!\r\n(Gordon rights the car with the gravity gun a drives off)\r\n\r\n(After a while Gordon comes to another resistance outpost)\r\nCitizen 1-Gordon Freeman! Hurry get in the basement! We are expecting\r\ngunships at any moment. Colonel Cubbage will be glad to see you made it.\r\n(Gordon heads down into the basement of the building where a man is \r\nspeaking to some other resistance members)\r\nColonel Cubbage-This steerable rocket launcher is our best bet for taking\r\ndown a gunship. Ah! Hello, I will be right with you. Now.. where was I? \r\nAh yes.. Using the laser guide, you can steer you rocket past the gunship\r\ndefenses and prevent it from shooting down your rocket. This will only anger\r\nit at first. But if you can survive long enough to make several direct hits,\r\nyou will be rewarded with a prize worthy of any mantle piece. Now? Who is\r\ngoing to be the lucky one to carry it into combat? Ah yes Gordon Freeman.\r\nI could not have asked for a finer volunteer.\r\n(Gordon takes the RPG)\r\nColonel Cubbage-Colonel Odessa Cubbage at your service.\r\n\r\n(An alarm begins to sound)\r\nCitizen 2-Gunship!\r\nColonel Cubbage-Damn! Let me just send a warning to lighthouse point, then I\r\nwill come right up and lend a hand!\r\n(Gordon goes outside and shoots down the gunship, he goes back down to the\r\nbasement)\r\nColonel Cubbage-Well thats that. I gather you have disposed of that gunship\r\nDr. Freeman, your reputation is well deserved. I will have someone open the\r\ngate for you immediately.\r\n(Gordon goes outside, a citizen opens the gate for him and he drives off)\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2h. Sandtraps\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\n(After driving for a very long time, Gordon comes to a resistance outpost\r\nstationed at a lighthouse)\r\nCitizen 1-Hey over here! You made it! We are picking up radio chatter,\r\nthey are looking for your car. Get you car in the garage.\r\n\r\n(Gordon drives his car into the garage and leaves it there, as this is\r\nhis destination)\r\nCitizen 1-Ok doc you will have to go on foot from here. There is a secret\r\npath along the cliffside, but no one is going anywhere until we fight off \r\nthis attack. Having you here to fight alongside us is going to make a big\r\ndifference for morale. Oh crap! Here come the dropships!\r\n(Gordon fights off the combine along with the resistance members, after the\r\nbattle one of them comes up and shows Gordon the way down the path)\r\nCitizen 2-This way Dr. Freeman, we will take the cliff path before the\r\ngunships find us. Right along there, and watch your step.\r\n(The secret door opens up and Gordon goes on foot down the path along\r\nthe edge of the cliff)\r\n\r\n(After a short while Gordon comes to a citizen and his friend\r\nlaying injured on a rock in the middle of the sand)\r\nCitizen 3-Hey you there! Dont move! Stay on the rocks! Stepping on the sand\r\nmakes the antlions crazy!\r\n(The injured citizen begins to get up)\r\nCitizen 3-Lazlo dont move!\r\n(The antlions crawl up from the sand and kill the injured citizen)\r\nCitizen 3-Dear god! Poor Lazlo. The finest mind of his generation come to\r\nsuch an end. You go on. There is nothing else you can do here.\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues on across the beach when he comes upon a very large\r\nantlion he kills it, and a vorigaunt emerges from a nearby outpost)\r\nVorigaunt-The freeman would be wise to heed out extraction of the \r\nmyrmadonts aromatic pheropods, the process is not entirely hygienic so\r\nplease, stand aside.\r\n(The vorigaunt harvests the bugbait from the corpse of the super antlion)\r\nVorigaunt-The freeman will have need of these on the road ahead. Gather them\r\nnow.\r\n(The vorigaunt leads Gordon back into the outpost and gives him some simple\r\ntraining on how to use the bugbait, he then raises a barrier and lets Gordon\r\nleave)\r\n\r\n(Gordon fights his way up the beach with the antlions helping him,\r\nafter a while he finally reaches Nova Prospekt)\r\n \r\n==============================================================================\r\n2i. Nova Prospekt\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\n(Gordon continues to fight his way on through Nova Prospekt with his army\r\nof antlions)\r\n\r\nNo dialogue in this level\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2j. Entanglement\r\n==============================================================================\r\n(Gordon finally meets up with Alyx after a short while, unfortunately he has \r\nlost control of the antlions and can no longer herd them)\r\nAlyx-I am glad you made it here in one piece. My dad is up there somewhere, in\r\nthat holding area. Its gonna take some doing to get him out. Lets get out of\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n(Gordon follows her down an elevator)\r\nAlyx-I am afraid that I am flying blind here. Every now and then a vorigaunt\r\ngets captured and sends back a little picture of this place. What we do know,\r\nis all bad.\r\n\r\n(Gordon fights his way along with Alyx and they come to a control room, she\r\nfinds her dad and they go after him, they come to the holding room where he is)\r\nAlyx-There he is!\r\nEli-Alyx! Gordon! Is that really you? I cant believe you found me!\r\nAlyx-Dad are you alright?!\r\nEli-Im fine but you have to get out of here.\r\nAlyx-We are here to get you out dad!\r\nEli-Nevermind me save yourselves!\r\nAylx-No we are not leaving you! I think I can recalibrate the combine portal\r\nto get us out of here.\r\nEli-But where will you go?\r\nAlyx-I talked to Dr. Kliener, his portal was almost working again. If he has\r\nmanaged to repair it then we will end up there. If he hasnt well... we would\r\nnot be any worse off.\r\nEli-Its not worth the risk honey! I cant lost you! Get out while you still \r\ncan!\r\nAlyx-We are not leaving here without you, thats final!\r\nEli-We cant leave without Judith either.\r\nAlyx-Dont worry dad we will find her. For now I am going to send you to the\r\nteleport room. I am not saying goodbye dad. We will meet you there.\r\nEli-I know you will honey.\r\n(Alyx uses the controls to send the pod Eli is in to the teleport room)\r\nAylx-Lets get out of here. I am going to head back to the security station\r\nand try to patch into your suit radio.\r\n(Alyx goes back while Gordon heads forward)\r\n\r\n(Alyx speaks through the suit)\r\nAlyx-Hey it worked, lets see what I can do to clear the way for you, keep an\r\neye out for Mossman. I will get my dad through the prison as far as I can then\r\nI will catch up to you.\r\n(Gordon comes to a closed gate)\r\nAlyx-Hang on I will get that gate open.\r\n(The gate opens)\r\n(Gordon comes to another closed gate)\r\nAlyx-Damn! It is jammed ok I have got an idea, head back to that office.\r\n(Gordon goes back and finds a vent he goes through)\r\nAlyx-Be careful Gordon I am picking up a lot of soldiers ahead.\r\n(Gordon comes to another gate)\r\nAlyx-I will start working on this gate, hang on.\r\n(Gordon moves on)\r\nAlyx-You are coming up to another control room, looks like it is still\r\noccupied.\r\n(Gordon clears the room)\r\nAlyx-My guess is that there are a bunch more soldiers heading your way.\r\nQuick search the room. There should be some combine turrets nearby. I can\r\nreprogram these turrets to attack the enemy. You set them up to defend the\r\ncontrol room. I cant shut down those fields from here. I am going to have to \r\ncatch up with you to access them. I am picking up a lot of incoming soldiers,\r\nhold the fort until I get there.\r\n\r\n(Gordon defends the room until Alyx falls down out of a vent in the ceiling)\r\nAlyx-Sorry it took me so long. Glad to see you are okay. Lets see if we can\r\nfind Mossman. It looks like this station might give me better access.\r\n(Alyx scrolls through some cameras and finds her)\r\nAlyx-There she is. Wait a minute. How did she..?\r\n(Mossman is talking to Dr. Breen)\r\nBreen-...from your area\r\nJudith-I am not calling about that, you promised you were not going to touch\r\nEli\r\nAlyx-What is she up to? Oh my god.\r\nBreen-The soldiers were a bit overzealous I admit, but he was too tempting\r\na prize to turn loose, especially in the absence of Gordon Freeman.\r\nJudith-You would have had Freeman if you had just been patient and waited\r\nfor my signal.</pre><pre id=\"faqspan-2\">\r\nBreen-We were not entirely sure you were ever going to get around to that,\r\nhuman loyalties being what they are.\r\nJudith-Dr. Breen, as I have stated before you have to let Eli come around\r\non his own, you cannot just..\r\nBreen-I have known Dr. Vance far longer than you my dear. I am afraid your\r\nfeelings for him might have blinded you.\r\nJudith-Feelings?  This has nothing to do with feelings. It is a simple truth\r\nthat when Eli believes in our..\r\nBreen-This is not open to debate Dr. Mossman.\r\nJudith-Doctor please..\r\nBreen-So sorry Judith I am all out of time.\r\n(The monitor shuts off)\r\nAlyx-Damn her! I dont believe this! Come on Gordon now we really have to\r\nhurry. Go on ahead I will disrupt the next level of security and will catch\r\nup to you when I can.\r\n(Gordon goes on ahead)\r\n\r\n(Gordon comes to a room with 3 turrets in it)\r\nAlyx-Quick get these set up, I see soldiers coming in from all directions.\r\n(Gordon sets up the turrets)\r\nAlyx-Here they come!\r\n(After a while of fighting of soldiers, Alyx talks to Gordon again)\r\nAlyx-Ok Gordon I am going to leave off here and catch up with you. be there as\r\nsoon as I can.\r\n(Alyx jumps down from a balcony above)\r\nAlyx-Sorry to take so long Gordon, I wont leave you again, now, lets go\r\ntrack down Mossman.\r\n\r\n(Alyx and Gordon head off to find Mossman, after a short distance they come to\r\na hallway, all the lights are shut off one by one)\r\nAlyx-uh-oh\r\n(A horde of Combine soldiers pour in, Gordon and Alyx fight them off and head\r\non)\r\n\r\n(They come to a control room)\r\nAlyx-Great another security station.\r\n(Alyx uses her hacking tool to hack the security station)\r\nAlyx-Alright Mossman where are you...\r\n(The monitor cycles to a image of Judith in a control room)\r\nAlyx-Ha! There you are!\r\n(Alyx inputs some commands and seals off the station that Judith is at)\r\nAlyx-Ha! Got you now! Well come on Gordon we dont want to keep her waiting.\r\n(They head to the next room, combine soldiers come out of a field gate)\r\nAlyx-Come on Gordon! Let me seal this door. No turning back now.\r\n\r\n(They run up to a window and see Judith inside)\r\nAylx-There she is. Leave the talking to me Gordon. We may need her to get\r\nout of here.\r\n(Alyx goes and bangs on the window)\r\nJudith-Hello? Oh thank god.. Someone is here. Alyx? Gordon? How did you get in\r\nhere?\r\nAylx-We know all about you and Breen. You have been a spy for the combine the \r\nwhole time.\r\nJudith-What? What are you talking about?\r\n(The sealed door begins to give way under the combine battery)\r\nAlyx-Dammit, move back Mossman we are coming in.\r\n(Alyx opens the door to the room)\r\nJudith-Alyx whatever you may think I assure you I am working to protect your\r\nfather.\r\nAylx-Shut up and be glad you are still of some use to us! We are going to \r\nreconfigure this teleport and get the hell out of here.\r\nJudith-You see we are working to the same end. I have already modulated the\r\nteleporter to emulate a xen relay.\r\nAylx-That is my fathers work you stole!\r\nJudith-Its my work to! And I had to prove to Dr. Breen that your father \r\nwould be the most valuable member of any research effort going forward from \r\nhere.\r\nAlyx-Enough of your bullshit!\r\n(The monitor shows Eli)\r\nAlyx-Look Gordon there is my dad, I am going to bring him in.\r\nJudith-You found Eli?\r\nAlyx-No thanks to you! Just enter the coordinates for Dr. Klieners lab and\r\nlets get moving.\r\nJudith-But we need access to the teleport platform and we are locked out.\r\nAlyx-I will take care of that.\r\n(The door to the teleport room opens)\r\nAlyx-Lets get going.\r\n\r\n(They all head into the teleport room which contains a teleport similar to the\r\none in Dr. Klieners lab but it is much taller)\r\nAylx-Oh my god. And you have been working with this thing? For how long?\r\nJudith-Never.. Until now. Though I did have a fairly good idea of what to\r\nexpect.\r\n(Eli comes in on the prison pod)\r\nAylx-I bet you did. It looks like it is waiting for us.\r\nJudith-The combine use a peculiar pulse-forming network with a very long\r\nrise time, It takes quite a while to recharge.\r\nAlyx-So you have warmed it up for us. Good. And just in time.\r\n(The prison pod opens)\r\nAlyx-Dad down here. Sorry we took so long I hope that was not too bad for you.\r\nEli-Do not worry about me sweetheart. Judith! I see they set you free!\r\nAylx-Not exactly.\r\nJudith-Eli! I was so worried about you!\r\nAlyx-The coordinates Dr. Mossman.\r\n(A large bang is heard at the sealed door)\r\nEli-So this is the combine portal, It is smaller than I imagined.\r\n(Eli is moved into the portal)\r\nAlyx-Hurry up Mossman!\r\n(Alyx contacts Dr. Kliener over the terminal)\r\nAylx-Dr. Kleiner!\r\nDr. Kliener-Yes Alyx where are you?\r\nAlyx-We are in Nova Prospekt, and we are running the Xen emulation for the\r\nfirst time. Are you ready for us?\r\nDr. Kliener-Ready! Willing! And fully enabled!\r\nAlyx-Good we will send my dad through first, he is in position for...\r\n(An alarm sounds)\r\nAylx-What was that? Hold on gotta bring this back down.\r\n(Mossman sneaks into the portal and starts it)\r\nAlyx-No! Stop! What are you doing!\r\nJudith-I am sorry Alyx, it is the only way.\r\nAlyx-No! Get back here!\r\nEli-Whats going on Alyx? Judith?\r\n(The portal starts to rise, as Alyx tries to stop it, it activates)\r\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener you have to stop them!\r\nDr. Kliener-Stop who my dear?\r\nAlyx-Oh my god! What coordinates are these? Where did she take him!\r\n(Another large bang is heard at the door)\r\nAlyx-No.. Cover me Gordon I have to reset the portal. Use the turrets!\r\n(A series of several bangs can be heard, the doors to the room finally\r\n are blown open by the combine, Gordon and alyx fight them off until the\r\nportal is ready)\r\nAlyx-Thank god it is done lets get the hell out of here!\r\n(Alyx and Gordon run into the portal, as it begins to raise the remaining\r\ndoors to the room blow open and soldiers flood out, the building begins to\r\ncollapse, just as a large cement piece is about to fall on the portal\r\nthey are teleported and the screen goes white)\r\n\r\n(The screen fades back in to reveal the room in Dr. Klieners lab with the\r\nteleporter in it)\r\nAlyx-My god we made it! But where is Dr. Kliener?\r\n(Alyx bangs on the secret wall)\r\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener let us out!\r\n(Dr. Kliener pops in with a shotgun)\r\nDr. Kliener-Aylx? Gordon? My god how did you get here and when?\r\nAlyx-What is wrong?\r\nDr. Kliener-My dear, I had given up hope of ever seeing you again.\r\nAlyx-I was thinking the same. I think the teleport exploded just as we made\r\nit out.\r\nDr. Kliener-Indeed it did. And the repercussions were felt far and wide..\r\nbut that was over a week ago.\r\nAlyx-What do you mean? Gordon and I were just there a minute ago.\r\nDr. Kiener-Fascinating. We seem to have developed a slow teleport. This\r\nsuggests an entirely new line of investigation.\r\nAlyx-A week..? Then what have we missed?\r\nDr. Kliener-A great deal my dear. The blow you struck at Nova Prospekt was\r\ntaken as a signal to start the uprising.\r\nAlyx-But what about my father?\r\nDr. Kliener-Well.. that is most disturbing. According to the vorigaunts\r\nhe is a prisoner at the citadel.\r\nAlyx-We have got to get my father out.\r\nDr. Kliener-Barney has been leading a push with that very aim in mind.\r\nAnd another of your friends arrived several days ago.\r\n(Dr. Kliener opens the room where the HEV suit used to be, inside is Dog)\r\nAlyx-Dog! You made it!\r\nDr. Kliener-So there. You see? Its not all hopeless.\r\nAlyx-I wish I shared your optimism doctor.\r\n(Barney appears over a monitor)\r\nBarney-Doc come in.. are you there?\r\nDr. Kliener-Yes barney and I am no longer alone. Alyx and Gordon have just\r\narrived.\r\nBarney-Well man thats good news, I almost gave you guys up for lost.\r\nWe are going to set up a staging area for the attack on the citadel.\r\nAlyx-Gordon and dog can head your way. I want to get Dr. Kliener somewhere\r\nsafer.\r\nBarney-I will take all the help I can get. Oh crap! Incoming!\r\n(A artillery shell flies by barney)\r\nBarney-Get going!\r\n\r\n(Gordon and Dog head out of the lab and onto the streets of City 17)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\nAnti-Citizen One\r\n==============================================================================\r\n(As Gordon and Dog head out to the streets a combine tank drives up, Dog picks \r\nit up and throws it into a building filled with soldiers, he then pries open a\r\nbarricade to let Gordon past, after Gordon is past he shuts it and jumps onto\r\na dropship, the dropship flies off with Dog on it)\r\n\r\n(Gordon meets up with some resistance members)\r\nResistance 1-Well Gordon Freeman, and about time to\r\nResistance 2-Gordon you are here!\r\nResistance 3-Dr. Freeman we are coming with you\r\n(They head off and continue on)\r\n\r\n(Gordon comes to an area sealed off by twisted metal and concrete)\r\nResistance 4-Gordon Freeman? It is you isnt it! Give me a minute, Im gonna\r\nplant some charges and blow this open.\r\n(After holding off combine forces for some time the area is blow open)\r\nResistance 4-Looks nasty in there! Good thing you have that suit!\r\n(Gordon makes it past the area and opens the locked door)\r\nResistance 4-I see you made it through okay, I figured you would.\r\n\r\n(Gordon finds a resistance member through a fence)\r\nResistance 5-Dr. Freeman? It is not safe here anymore. They are shelling the\r\nhell out of us. I will send word you are coming up ahead. Keep moving.\r\n(Gordon continues on with his squad)\r\n\r\n(He comes to a room with 2 turrets, after knocking them down the door blows\r\nopen and Alyx comes in)\r\nAlyx-Gordon! I had a feeling I would find you here. I have got Dr. Kliener in\r\na safe spot. Now we can join up with Barney. There is a command center \r\ndownstairs, I am hoping to find information on generator locations. Ready?\r\nLets go.\r\n(Gordon and Alyx go downstairs and reach the command center)\r\nAlyx-Well we are in luck, there is a generator in the square outside. We are\r\ntrying to disable as many as we can to loosen the combines grip on the city.\r\nIt will take me a few minutes to expose the core, then I will need you to hit\r\nit with a burst from the gravity gun. In the meantime watch my back.\r\n(Gordon and Alyx head outside to the plaza, Alyx starts to disable the\r\ngenerator)\r\nAlyx-This should not take too long. As soon as it is down, I will open that\r\ngate and we can get out of here.\r\n(Gordon fights off the combine forces as Alyx tries to open the generator)\r\nAlyx-Ok the core is exposed. Use the gravity gun Gordon!\r\n(Gordon uses the gravity gun to push the energy source out of the core)\r\nAlyx-All right, I am opening the gate.\r\n\r\n(They both run through the gate and Alyx shuts it)\r\nAlyx-Ok, Barney should be on the far side of that...canal. Well there used to\r\nbe a bridge here. Let me see if I can scout a new path. Ah! Wait for me here.\r\n(Alyx climbs up a drain pipe to the top of a building)\r\nAlyx-Hey! Looks like we might be able to get through down there! Lets head\r\nthat way!\r\n(Bullets are fired at Alyx)\r\nAlyx-Ah! No! Gordon! Run! Get out of here!\r\n\r\n(Gordon runs off into the sewers)\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2l. Follow Freeman!\r\n==============================================================================\r\n(After getting through the sewers Gordon finds another resistance member)\r\nResistance 1-Dr. Freeman! Barney said you were on your way. We got split up by\r\nsnipers, and he is pinned down in a warehouse up ahead. Go ahead, he is\r\nrelying on you.\r\n\r\n(Gordon heads past the snipers and finds a wounded resistance member in the\r\nbasement of the warehouse)\r\nResistance 2-Help! Is somebody up there? Help! Help me! We thought we would be\r\nsafer down here. Little did we know the place was infested. The rest of them\r\nheaded upstairs, took their chances with the snipers. I guess they are still\r\nup there.\r\n\r\n(Gordon heads upstairs and sees Barney)\r\nBarney-Over here! Gordon I cant move, these snipers have got me pinned down.\r\nGordon lob a couple grenades, that will clear them out.\r\n(Gordon blows out the snipers with grenades)\r\nBarney-Alright, thanks Gordon, now lets clear out of here.\r\n\r\n(Gordon and Barney head out of the building and to a security gate)\r\nBarney-Let me get this gate. My Civil Protection status still gives me limited\r\nclearance. Did you hear a cat just now? That damn thing haunts me.\r\n(Barney opens the gate and they both continue on)\r\n\r\n(They come to a building and some resistance members join them)\r\nBarney-There is an old building up ahead. A bank or museum or something like\r\nthat. Whatever the hell it used to be, now it is a nexus for Overwatch in\r\nCity 17. It is the main source of pain for this part of town, thanks to a huge\r\nsuppression device that rains down hell from the roof of the place.\r\n(They come to a window)\r\nBarney-There it is, the Overwatch nexus. Looks like they are mobilizing \r\nbig-time. You can sort of see the gate from here. I will show you when we get\r\nto street level. We have to get into that building to open the gate. Even then\r\nthe suppression device will, suppress anyone who tries to come through unless\r\nwe shut it down.\r\n(As Gordon goes into the next room a camera detects him and an alarm goes off)\r\nBarney-So much for stealth. We have been spotted!\r\n(They reach the street)\r\nBarney-There is the gate I was telling you about. We have to come back here\r\nafter we get it open. If we get it open. First we gotta get into the nexus\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n(Barney and Gordon fight past the combine and get into the building)\r\nBarney-Uh-oh, turrets. You have the HEV suit, you deal with them. Then I will\r\nopen the door.\r\n\r\n(Barney and Gordon fight past the combine into the building and come to a room\r\nwith lasers)\r\nBarney-Wow, with that much security there must be something good in there.\r\nGo for it doc. I will wait here until you shut I down.\r\n(Gordon gets past the lasers and shuts it down)\r\n\r\n(After disabling the final generator Barney and Gordon head for the roof)\r\nBarney-Ah here it is, roof access. I am going to stay here and help other\r\nresistance members come through.\r\n\r\n(After fighting his way up to and down from the roof Gordon finds another\r\nresistance member)\r\nResistance 3-Dr. Freeman! Since you shut off the suppressor and opened the\r\ngate, we can really move people through now. The combine is really going to\r\nfeel the squeeze! We dropped a crate of rockets across the plaza. If you can\r\nmake it there you can take down the striders.\r\n\r\n(After fighting his way through City 17 and past a whole mess of striders\r\nGordon finds Dog bursting through a barricade of cars with Barney running\r\nbehind him)\r\nBarney-Dog! Here boy! Dog come back here! Damn it all! Gordon! Hey help me\r\nout here!\r\n(They run over to the citadel wall)\r\nBarney-Dog came crashing through the plaza, knocking over walls, I think he\r\nis looking for Alyx. He seems to have it set in his mind that she is in the\r\ncitadel. I figured Alyx would not want him getting into any deeper trouble but\r\nhell, you try stopping him.\r\n(Dog pulls  up the citadel wall)\r\nBarney-Hey dog! Not there! You cannot get through that way!\r\n(Dog lifts it all the way up)\r\nBarney-Well I will be dammed. I think he wants you to go through Gordon,\r\nyou had better hurry.\r\n(Gordon jumps into the hole)\r\nBarney-And if you see Dr. Breen, tell him I said f--- -ou!*\r\n\r\n(Gordon heads down into the citadel through the underground)\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2m. Our Benefactors\r\n==============================================================================\r\n(Gordon rides along the prison pod conveyor system to get to the top of the \r\ncitadel, he gets the upgraded gravity gun and probably enjoys throwing some \r\ncombine fools around the building)\r\n\r\nNo dialogue in this level\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n2n. Dark Energy\r\n==============================================================================\r\n(Gordon reaches the top of the citadel in the prison pod, the guards take the\r\nblue gravity gun from him and Judith comes in)\r\nJudith-I will take him from here. Dont struggle, its no use. Until you are\r\nwhere he wants you there is nothing you can do. I am sorry Gordon.\r\n\r\n(Judith leads the pod into a room with Eli and Dr. Breen talking)\r\nDr. Breen-..ancient stars colonized by sentient fungi. Gas giants, inhabited\r\nby vast meteorological intelligences. Worlds stretched thin across the\r\nmembranes where dimensions intersect...Impossible to describe with our limited\r\nvocabulary!\r\nEli-What I have seen is also beyond words Breen. Genocide, indescribable \r\nevil...Good god.\r\nDr. Breen-Well if it isnt Gordon Freeman at last.\r\n(The guard shows Breen the gravity gun)\r\nDr. Breen-Oh what is this? Put it over there.\r\n(The guard puts it on the desk)\r\nDr. Breen-You have my gratitude Dr. Freeman, first you lead me to the doorstep\r\nof my oldest friend, then you deliver yourself. If I had known you were going\r\nto come straight up to my office I would not have bothered hunting you in the\r\nfirst place. Having both of you in my keeping ensures I can dictate the terms\r\nof any bargain I care to make with the Combine.\r\nJudith-Dr. Breen..Wallace..\r\nDr. Breen-Yes what is it Judith?\r\nJudith-The bargain we should be making is for his life so he can continue his\r\nresearch!\r\nDr. Breen-Thanks to you we have everything we need in that regard. You are \r\nmore than qualified to finish his research yourself. What neither you nor I\r\ncan do is convince that rabble in the streets to give up their senseless \r\nstruggle. Yet Eli refuses to speak the words that would save them all.\r\nEli-Save them?! For what?!\r\nDr. Breen-Eli.. If you will not do this for the good of all people, maybe\r\nyou will do it for one of them.\r\n(The mechanical arm takes Alyx out of the prison pod)\r\nEli-Alyx..Honey..\r\nAlyx-Dad! Huh.. Gordon? No..\r\nEli-God damn you Breen! You let her go!\r\nDr. Breen-That is all up to you my old friend. Will you let your stubborn\r\nshort sightedness doom the entire species? Or will you give your child the\r\nchance her mother never had?\r\n(Alyx spits in his face)\r\nAlyx-How dare you even mention her!\r\nDr. Breen-Alyx my dear you have your mothers eyes. But your fathers\r\nstubbornness.\r\nAlyx-You have not seen a bit of it yet.\r\nDr. Breen-Really? Well lets see how it serves you, on the far side of a\r\ncombine portal.\r\nEli-Go ahead Breen! If that is the worst you can do, send us through your\r\nportal.\r\nDr. Breen-Oh it is hardly the worst. But you might find that hard to believe\r\nonce you get there.\r\nJudith-It isnt necessary!\r\nDr. Breen-I agree it is a total waste. Fortunately the resistance has shown\r\nit is willing to accept a new leader. And this one has proven to be a fine\r\npawn for those who control him.\r\nEli-No!\r\nAlyx-Dont listen to him Gordon!\r\nDr. Breen-How about it Dr. Freeman? Did you realize your contract was open to\r\nthe highest bidder?\r\nAlyx-Gordon would never make any kind of deal with you!\r\nDr. Breen-I understand if you dont wish to discuss this in front of your\r\nfriends. I will send them on their way and then we can talk openly.\r\nEli-Dont struggle honey.\r\nAlyx-Dad.. Im so sorry.\r\nEli-Alyx..sweetheart.\r\n(Judith uses the hacking tool on the console)\r\nDr. Breen-Judith, what do you think you are doing?\r\nJudith-We are doing what I could never do alone. We are stopping you.\r\nAlyx-Yes!\r\n(Breen uses the intercom)\r\nDr. Breen-Guards! Get in here!\r\n(Judith uses the hacking tool on the intercom, the guards begin banging on the\r\ndoor)\r\nDr. Breen-They know you betrayed them, they will turn on you, Judith..\r\nDr. Mossman please!\r\nJudith-I am sorry Wallace, you are all out of time.\r\n(Judith begins using the console, Breen tries to stop her)\r\nJudith-Dont!\r\n(As Judith is freeing Gordon Breen grabs the gravity gun)\r\nAlyx-Hurry! Dad hang on!\r\nDr. Breen-You fool!\r\nAlyx-Watch out he is gonna..\r\nDr. Breen-No!\r\n(Breen fires the gun, Gordon gets up and he is free)\r\nAlyx-Dad!\r\nEli-Oh no no no. Dont worry about me honey.\r\nJudith-There is no time Alyx, he is on his way to the portal. You will need\r\nthis.\r\n(Judith gives Alyx the hacking tool)\r\nAlyx-Dr. Mossman..Judith.. Look after my father.\r\nJudith-Dont you worry.\r\nAlyx-Dad I am not saying goodbye.\r\nEli-Never.\r\nAlyx-Come on Gordon, lets go.\r\n\r\n(Alyx and Gordon get into the elevator)\r\nAlyx-Gordon.. We have not known each other very long, but I know you did not\r\nhave to do this. I had to rescue my father, but you.. well.. thanks for coming\r\nafter me.\r\nAlyx-Hey listen!\r\n(Breen is talking to someone)\r\nDr. Breen-It is me you should be concerned about, I can still deliver earth\r\nbut not without your help.\r\nAlyx-That is him!\r\nDr. Breen-The portal destination is untenable surely you can set the relay \r\ndestination elsewhere. There is no way I can survive in that environment.\r\nA host body? You must be joking, there is no way I can possibly..\r\nAlyx-There he is!\r\nDr. Breen-Oh alright dammit if that is what it takes. Just hurry! He is right\r\nbehind me!\r\n(Alyx uses the hacking tool on the force shield)\r\nDr. Breen-Oh shit!\r\n(Gordon picks up the gravity gun, and Breen gets into another elevator and\r\nshuts the door before he can get in)\r\nAlyx-Dammit! Not again! Huh! The gravity gun! He does not have a clue does he?\r\nI wonder where he is going.\r\n(The metal shield opens up to reveal the top of the citadel)\r\nAlyx-Oh my god! This is the dark fusion reactor. It powers their tunneling\r\nentanglement device. We will never have a chance like this again. We have to \r\nstop him!\r\n(Alyx uses the consoles)\r\nAlyx-I cannot shut it down, looks like he has turned control over to the other\r\nside. You will have to go into the core and do what you can. Get into the\r\nelevator and I will let you in. Do not forget to charge up your suit.\r\n\r\n(Gordon gets into the elevator and Alyx lets him down into the core, he sees\r\nDr. Breen in the tower in the center inside a glowing orb, as he goes up the \r\nchamber Breen taunts him)\r\nAlyx-Its Dr. Breen! There he is!\r\nDr. Breen-Dr. Freeman, you really should not be out there. At the moment of \r\nsynapse as I teleport this chamber will be bathed in deadly particles that\r\nhave yet to be named by human science. Perhaps when I have the leisure to do\r\nthe work myself, I will name one after you. That way you will not be \r\ncompletely forgotten. When the singularity collapses, I will be far away from \r\nhere, in another universe in fact. You on the other hand will be destroyed in\r\nevery way possible, and even some essentially impossible.\r\nAlyx-What the hell? Oh no, combine soldiers, where did they come from?\r\nDr. Breen-I do not know what you can possibly hope to achieve, apart from your\r\nown annihilation.\r\nAlyx-Do not listen to him Gordon!\r\nDr. Breen-I warned you this was futile.\r\nAlyx-He is bluffing Gordon. Do not listen to him!\r\n(Gordon reaches the center)\r\nAlyx-Great! Oh no, Breen has started his ascent! Hurry Gordon before he\r\nescapes!\r\nDr. Breen-I could have told you that was pointless Dr. Freeman.\r\nAlyx-Go Gordon!\r\nDr. Breen-Are you still with us Dr. Freeman? Not for much longer I think.\r\n(Gordon reaches the top)\r\nAlyx-Oh my god, the portal is opening!\r\nDr. Breen-I hope you have said your farewells.\r\n(Gordon uses the gravity gun to shoot the energy balls into the portal)\r\nDr. Breen-Go back Freeman, you have no idea what you are doing!\r\n(Gordon continues to wreck the portal)\r\nDr. Breen-You do not know what you will unleash, you could bring down this\r\nwhole citadel. Think, man, think of the people below!\r\n(Gordon blows up the portal)\r\nDr. Breen-NO! You need me!\r\nAlyx-Yes!\r\n(The shield covering the control room shuts off and Alyx steps out)\r\nAlyx-Yeah! You did it! Come on Gordon we have got to get out of here, maybe\r\nwe still have...\r\n\r\n(The portal collapses and explodes, time begins to slow down and the Gman\r\nslowly appears)\r\nGman-Time? Dr. Freeman? Is it really that time again? It seems as if you only\r\njust arrived. You have done a great deal in a small timespan. You have done\r\nso well that I have received some interesting offers for your services. \r\nOrdinarily I would not contemplate them, but these are extraordinary times.\r\nRather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of\r\nchoosing for you. If and when the time comes again.\r\n(The background begins to fade away into black, a greenish light appears)\r\nGman-I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition,\r\nDr. Freeman, I trust it will all make sense in the course of.. well.. I am \r\nreally not at liberty to say.\r\n(The background becomes a black tunnel with white strands of light flying by)\r\nGman-In the meantime, this is where I get off.\r\n(A door slides open in the air and the Gman steps in and the door shuts behind\r\nhim and the credits roll)\r\n\r\nEnd of game\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n3.

Notes\\r\\n\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n1. Introduction\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nHalf-Life 2, possibly the greatest PC game ever made in my opinion. \\r\\nHalf-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life (duh), in which Gordon Freeman (the \\r\\ncharacter you play as), has to fight his way out of the black mesa research \\r\\nfacility after a science experiment goes horribly wrong.  Half-Life 2 takes \\r\\nplace an unspecified amount of years after Half-Life. This FAQ will list in\\r\\ndetail the game script.\\r\\n\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n2. Script\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe script I list will only be the scripted (no pun intended) parts of the \\r\\ngame, for example I wont list things that your squad mates say, like Here take \\r\\nthis medkit. I will separate different conversations with simple empty lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2a. Point Insertion\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\nGman-Rise and shine Mr. Freeman, rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply that \\r\\nyou have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest than you.\\r\\nAnd all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until.... Well lets \\r\\njust say your hour has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make \\r\\nall the difference in the world. So wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the \\r\\nashes.\\r\\n(The gman slowly fades away into the background and his image is replaced with \\r\\nthe viewpoint of Gordon Freeman on a train pulling into a station)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 1-I didnt see you get on.  This is my third transfer this year.\\r\\nCitizen 2-No matter how many times I get relocated I never get used to it.\\r\\n(the train pulls into the station and stops)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Well, end of the line.\\r\\n(as Gordon gets off the train he is scanned by a small flying device, a large \\r\\nmonitor with a face on it begins to speak)\\r\\n\\r\\nMonitor/Breen-Welcome, welcome to city 17, you have chosen or been chosen to \\r\\nrelocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.  I thought so much of \\r\\ncity 17 that I elected to establish my administration here, in the citadel so \\r\\nthoughtfully provided by our benefactors. I have been proud to call city 17 my \\r\\nhome. So whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts \\r\\nunkown, welcome to city 17, it is safer here.\\r\\n\\r\\nCivil Patrol-First warning move away.\\r\\nCitizen 3-It, Its all I have left.\\r\\n(the civil patrolman shoves the citizen into his luggage)\\r\\nCivil Patrol-Move it.\\r\\nCitizen 3-Alright, alright I am moving, jeez.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 4-Were you the only ones on that train? Overwatch stopped our train in \\r\\nthe woods and took my husband for questioning.  They said he would be on the \\r\\nnext train, I am not sure when that was.  They are being nice and letting me \\r\\nwait though.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 5-Dont drink the water, they, they put something in it to make you \\r\\nforget, I dont even remember how I got here.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 6-Dr. Breen again? I was hoping I had seen the last of him in city 14.\\r\\nCitizen 7- I wouldnt say that to loud, this is his base of operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon looks down to the end of the checkpoint where he sees citizens\\r\\nbeing led through)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2-You, Citizen come with me.\\r\\nCitizen 8-Wai, Wait a minute where are you...\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2-GET IN HERE!\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2- Go on!\\r\\nCitizen 8-ME?\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2-I SAID MOVE!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to a fenced in area, a civil patrolman blocks his path, he goes \\r\\nthe other way and when he enters the caged area both doors shut and an alarm \\r\\nsounds, he is scanned by a camera)\\r\\n\\r\\nCivil Patrol 3-Dont move, hold it\\r\\n(the side door opens)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 4-You citizen, come with me.\\r\\n(Gordon follows him down a hallway, as he looks into a room he can see a \\r\\ncitizen being intterogated)\\r\\nCitizen 9-This must be a mistake, I got a standard relocation coupon just like \\r\\neveryone else.\\r\\n(before Gordon can see anything more the civil patrol man in this room shuts \\r\\nthe viewing slot on the door)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to the last door in the hall way, the civil patrolman knocks on \\r\\nthe door and it opens to reveal another civil patrolman)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 4-Get in! Need any help with this one?\\r\\nCivil Patrol 5-No I am good\\r\\n(Civil Patrolman 4 leaves the room)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 5-Back up!\\r\\nCivil Patrol 5-Yeah I am gonna need me some privacy for this\\r\\n(civil patrolman 5 uses his console to turn off the 2 cameras in the room)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 5-Now...\\r\\n(the civil patrolman takes off his helmet and reveals himself to be barney)\\r\\nBarney-About that beer I owed ya. Its me Gordon, barney from black mesa. \\r\\nSorry for the scare I had to put on a show for the cameras. I have been\\r\\nworking undercover with civil protection, I cant take too long or they will \\r\\nget suspicious, I am way behind on my beating quota\\r\\n(a man in a lab coat appears on the screen on the console in front of barney)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Yes barney what is it? I am in the middle of a critical test.\\r\\nBarney-Sorry doc, but look whos here.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Great Scott! Gordon Freeman! I expected more warning.\\r\\nBarney-Yeah you and me both doc. He was about to board the express train to \\r\\nNova Prospekt.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well, Barney what do you intend to do?\\r\\nBarney-Im thinking, Im thinking.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Alyx is around here somewhere, she would have an idea of how to\\r\\nget him here.\\r\\nBarney-Well, as long as he stays away from checkpoints we should be okay.  \\r\\nListen I gotta go doc, we are taking enough chances as it is.\\r\\nDr. Kleiner-Very well. And eh Gordon? Its good to see you.\\r\\n(the monitor shuts off)\\r\\nBarney-Okay Gordon your going to have to make your way to Dr. Klieners lab.\\r\\n(there is a loud knocking at the door)\\r\\nBarney-Oh man! That is what I was afraid of! Get in here Gordon! Before you \\r\\nblow my cover!\\r\\n(barney releases the lock on the back door)\\r\\nBarney-Pile up some stuff to get to that window and keep going till your in\\r\\nthe plaza. I will meet up with you later.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon escapes out the window and arrives at another building, a civil \\r\\npatrolman blocks his only path, he knocks a can over)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 6-Pick up that can. Now put it in the trash can.\\r\\n(reluctantly Gordon puts it in the trash can)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 6-Alright you can go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to a large plaza, with gates branching to different areas of the \\r\\ncity, he continues past the plaza outside, beyond the plaza lies a extremely \\r\\nlarge building, he makes his way down the street to a area with 2 buildings,\\r\\none of the entrances is guarded by civil patrolman)\\r\\nCitizen 10-This is how it always starts, first one building, then the entire \\r\\nblock.\\r\\nCitizen 11-They have no reason to come to our place.\\r\\nCitizen 10-Dont worry, they will find one.\\r\\n(Gordon enters the entrance of the non-guarded building)\\r\\n\\r\\n(as he makes his way up the stairs he sees a group of 4 civil patrolmen knock \\r\\ndown a door and rush in too a room, he enters the adjacent room)\\r\\nCitizen 12-Oh, I thought you were a cop.\\r\\nCitizen 13-Dont worry he is one of us.\\r\\nCitizen 12-Look at them down there.\\r\\nCitizen 13-I told you they would be coming for us next!\\r\\nCitizen 12-Just this once I hope you are wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n(as he makes his way further up the building a voice sounds)\\r\\nWarning Voice-Attention residents, miscount detected in your sector\\r\\nCitizen 14-Psst! Hey you! In here! Head for the roof! There is no time to lose!\\r\\nCitizen 15-Run for your life!\\r\\nCitizen 16-Civil Protection!\\r\\nCitizen 17-CPs!\\r\\nCitizen 16-Here they come!\\r\\n(Civil protection starts raiding the building and Gordon runs for the roof \\r\\nalong with other citizens)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 18-Get in here quick!\\r\\n(the citizen shuts the door to the room and holds his body against it)\\r\\nCitizen 18-Head for the roof! I will keep them busy!\\r\\n(a chase ensues with Gordon running across a series of rooftops with civil \\r\\nprotection chasing him)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon reaches a open window and goes inside, he heads down a staircase which \\r\\ncollapses behind him, civil protection close in on him)\\r\\nAlyx-Over Here! Ha! No you dont!\\r\\n(the screen goes white and Gordon is knocked unconscious)\\r\\n(as Gordon wakes up he sees alyx and the bodies of the CPs that were chasing \\r\\nhim)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Freeman I presume? We better hurry, the combine can be slow to wake, \\r\\nbut once they are up you will have a hard time taking them down.\\r\\n(alyx opens an elevator and Gordon heads down it along with her)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener said you might be coming this way. I dont think it occurred to \\r\\nhim that you might not have a map.\\r\\nAlyx-Im Alyx Vance, my father worked with you back in black mesa, but im sure \\r\\nyou dont remember him.\\r\\nAlyx-Man of few words arent you?\\r\\nAlyx-Remember him from black mesa? Your old administrator?\\r\\n(alyx gestures to a picture of the same man that was on the large monitor)\\r\\nAylx-Ha! Dont get my dad started on Dr. Breen.\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2b. A Red Letter Day\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\nAylx-Funny you showing up on this day in particular.\\r\\nAylx-We have been helping people escape the city on foot. Its a dangerous route \\r\\nto my fathers lab through the old canals, today we are finally on the verge of \\r\\nhaving a better way.\\r\\nAlyx-Here lemme buy you a drink\\r\\n(alyx puts a coin into a vending machine, the machine opens like a door to \\r\\nreveal a passage behind it that leads to Dr. Klieners lab)\\r\\nAlyx-Oh and by the way, nice to finally meet you.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon enters the lab and sees Dr. Kliener)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Blast that little.. where did she get to? Llamar? Come out of there.\\r\\nAylx-Uh-oh, everything alright Dr. Kliener?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Oh, hello Alyx. Well almost alright, Llamar has gotten out of her \\r\\ncrate again. If I didnt know better, I would suspect barney of trapping and..\\r\\nMy goodness, Gordon Freeman, It really is you isnt it?\\r\\nAlyx-I found him wandering around outside, bit of a troublemaker isnt he?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-We owe a great deal to Dr. Freeman, even if trouble does seem to \\r\\nfollow in his wake.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-I must say Gordon you have come at a very opportune time, Alyx has \\r\\njust installed the final piece in the resurrected teleport!\\r\\nAlyx-I cant take any credit for the breakthrough doctor.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Nonsense, your talents surpass your loveliness.\\r\\nAylx-Lets just see if this thing works ok?\\r\\n\\r\\n(barney enters the lab)\\r\\nBarney-Well is he here? There you are! Man Gordon you stirred up the hive!\\r\\nBarney-We cant keep him here long doc, It will jeporadize everything we have \\r\\nworked for.\\r\\nAlyx-Dont worry he is coming with me.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Thats right Barney, this is a red letter day, we will inaugurate \\r\\nthe new teleport with a double transmission.\\r\\nBarney-You mean its working? For real this time? Because I still have \\r\\nnightmares about that cat.\\r\\nAlyx-What cat?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Now now there is nothing to be worried about, we have made major \\r\\nstrides since then. Major strides.\\r\\nAylx-What cat?\\r\\nBarney-Doc, since he is not taking the streets you might as well get him out\\r\\nof his civvies.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-What? Oh dear you are right, I almost forgot. Barney I will give \\r\\nyou the honor.\\r\\nBarney-I have gotta get back on my shift but ok.\\r\\n\\r\\n(barney uses a keypad to open up a garage like door, inside this small room \\r\\nthere is a glass case which contains the HEV suit)\\r\\nBarney-Here we go.. Awahh!\\r\\n(Dr. Klieners pet headcrab Llamar jumps on barney)\\r\\nBarney-Damn it! Get it off me!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Llamar! There you are!\\r\\nBarney-I though you got rid of that pest!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Certainly not. Never fear Gordon, she is de-beaked and completely \\r\\nharmless. The worst she might try to do is couple with your head. Fruitlessly.\\r\\nLlamar-Guwakkh!\\r\\nBarney-Get that thing away from me!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Here my pet. Hop up!\\r\\n(Llamar jumps up onto a shelf with some crates and computers)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-No not up there!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-No, No! Careful Llamar those are quite fragile.\\r\\n(Llamar jumps into a vent)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Oh fie! It will be another week before I can coax here out of \\r\\nthere!\\r\\nBarney-Yeah. Longer if we are lucky.\\r\\nAlyx-Barney.. You are not an animal person?\\r\\nBarney-Ugh.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well Gordon go ahead, slip into your suit now.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon steps into the glass chamber and puts the HEV suit on)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well Gordon I see your HEV suit still fits you like a glove, at \\r\\nleast the glove parts do.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-I have made a few modifications, but I will just acquaint you with \\r\\nthe essentials, now lets see..\\r\\n(Dr. Kliener picks up a clipboard with a paper on it and begins reading from \\r\\nthe paper)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-The Mark V Hazardous Environment Suit has been redesigned for \\r\\ncomfort and utility..\\r\\n\\r\\n(A loud alarm sounds in the background)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Oh dear!\\r\\nBarney-Doc we dont have time for this. At least get that suit juiced up Gordon.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Good idea, there is a charger on the wall. I have modified your \\r\\nsuit to draw power from combine energy outlets, which are plentiful wherever \\r\\nthey patrol.\\r\\nAylx-Meanwhile, lets get this show on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Dr. Kliener moves a picture frame around, this opens up a retinal scanner \\r\\nwhich he uses to open up a secret room behind the wall, Gordon enters the room \\r\\nalong with everyone else, inside is a large mass of computers and wires along \\r\\nwith a platform in the middle of the room, Alyx gets onto the platform and the \\r\\nguard rails close behind her)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, why dont you position yourself near the panel over there \\r\\nand wait for my word?\\r\\n\\r\\n(A man appears on a monitor behind barney)\\r\\nEli-Issac are you there?\\r\\nDr. Kiener-Yes, yes, Eli, a bit of a hold up on this end. You will never \\r\\nguess who found his way into our lab this morning.\\r\\nEli-Thats not who I think it is, is it?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Indeed it is, and its our intention to send him packing straight \\r\\naway, in the company of your lovely daughter.\\r\\nAylx-Are you ready for us dad?\\r\\nEli-We are all set on this end.\\r\\nAylx-Then lets do it\\r\\n(the platform Alyx is standing on begins to rise)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Lets see, the massless field flux should self-limit and I have \\r\\nclamped the manifold parameters to include CY Hilbert and GC orbitfold \\r\\ninclusive. Conditions could not be more ideal.\\r\\nBarney-Thats what you said last time.\\r\\nAylx-Hey, uh, yeah, about that cat..\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Initializing in three.. two.. one.. Oh fiddlesticks what now?\\r\\n(One of the plugs comes lose out of its outlet)\\r\\nAylx-Uh, doctor the plug.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Dear me, you are right, Gordon would you mind plugging us in.\\r\\n(Gordon plugs the cord back in)\\r\\nAlyx-You gonna let Gordon throw the switch?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, go right ahead.\\r\\n(Gordon throws the switch)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Very good, final sequence commencing..now.\\r\\nBarney-I cant look.\\r\\nAlyx-Uh, ok, oh ah ohhh!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Aylx disappears from the teleporter)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well, did it work?\\r\\nEli-See for yourself\\r\\nAylx-Hey doc!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Thank goodness, my relief is almost palpable\\r\\nEli-Fantastic work Izzy\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well I cant take all the credit, Dr. Freeman proved an able \\r\\nassistant\\r\\nEli-Lets go ahead and bring Gordon through now.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Right you are, speak to you again in a few moments.\\r\\nBarney-Good job Gordon, throwing that switch and all, I can see your M.I.T.\\r\\neducation really pays off.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Alright Barney, your turn.\\r\\nBarney-Gee thanks\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Gordon, as soon as you are in position we will send you to Eli.\\r\\n(The loud alarm sounds again)\\r\\nBarney-And not a moment too soon\\r\\n(Gordon steps into the teleporter, the guardrails close and it begins to rise)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Excellent, initializing, in three.. two.. one.., eh Barney if you \\r\\nwould be so kind?\\r\\nBarney-Good luck out there Gordon\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Yes indeed, we are ready to project you Gordon, best of luck in \\r\\nyour future endeavors, and bon voyage, final sequence.\\r\\n\\r\\n(An alarm begins to sound)\\r\\nBarney-What the hell?\\r\\n(Llamar jumps out of a vent a breaks some wires connected to the teleporter)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-What is it?\\r\\nBarney-Its your pet the freaking head humper!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Llamar? Hedy! No!\\r\\nBarney-Look out!\\r\\n(Llamar jumps onto the teleport as it begins to malfunction, Gordon is \\r\\ntransported to a beach, then back to the lab)\\r\\nBarney-There he is!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Is Llamar with him?\\r\\nBarney-Forget about that thing!\\r\\n(Gordon is now transported to his intended destination)\\r\\nAlyx-He is coming through dad!\\r\\nEli-What is going on Judith?\\r\\nJudith-Im not sure, it seems to be some kind of interference.\\r\\nEli-Gordon stay put we will get ya out of there.\\r\\nJudith-Something is drawing him away.\\r\\n(Gordon is teleported into an unknown location, he sees the same man he saw on \\r\\nthe monitor)\\r\\nBreen-What is the meaning of this? Who are you? How did you get in here?\\r\\n(Gordon is now teleported back to the lab)\\r\\nBarney-He is back, Im getting him outta there.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-You cant just wade into the field! It will peel you apart!\\r\\nAlyx-We just lost Gordon what is going on?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-I wish I knew, Im encountering unexpected interference\\r\\nBarney-Dont worry Gordon we will..\\r\\n(Gordon is transported back to his original destination)\\r\\nAylx-There he is!\\r\\nJudith-Ah! We are losing him again!\\r\\n(Gordon is transported back to the unknown location)\\r\\nBreen-The man I saw, im all but certaint it was... Gordon Freeman\\r\\n(Gordon is transported underwater, A giant alien comes rushing at him but he \\r\\nis transported again at the last second, this time he is outside of the lab\\r\\nlooking in through a window behind Dr. Kliener)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-What do you mean he is not there?\\r\\nEli-He didnt come through.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Then where is he?\\r\\nEli-Behind you.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Ahh!\\r\\nEli-Shut it down! Shut it down!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Gordon run! You must get out of here!\\r\\nBarney-Get down outta sight I will come find you!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon makes his way through the area behind the lab until he sees barney on a \\r\\nledge above)\\r\\nBarney-Gordon! I have never seen the citadel on full alert like that! Take the \\r\\nold canals out of city 17 to Eli, its dangerous but there is a whole network\\r\\nof resistance members who run the underground railroad. I would come with you \\r\\nbut I have to look after Dr. Kliener. Oh and before I forget, I think you \\r\\ndropped this back at black mesa.\\r\\n(Barney throws down a crowbar)\\r\\nBarney-Good luck out there buddy, you are gonna need it.\\r\\n(Gordon makes his way away from the lab and through a train station while \\r\\nbeing chased by civil protection)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2c. Route Kanal\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon makes his way through the sewers of city 17 while being chased by civil \\r\\nprotection, as he rounds a corner he comes upon the scene of yet another\\r\\ncombine beating)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 1-Help me! Stop we didnt do anything!\\r\\n(The combine soldiers are beating the husband of the woman, they notice\\r\\nfreeman and come after him instead, he kills them with his crowbar)\\r\\nCitizen 1-They will be looking for you now. You should run there is nothing\\r\\nelse you can do here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues his trek through the sewers while fighting civil protection, \\r\\nafter passing over same train tracks Gordon finds a citizen and a vorigaunt)\\r\\nCitizen 2-Good god! Guess those sirens are for you huh? Good thing you found \\r\\nus, you are not the first to come through by a..\\r\\nVorigaunt-This is the freeman, the reckoning of the combine has come.\\r\\nCitizen 2-Look we are just a lookout for the underground railroad. Main \\r\\nstation is right around the corner. They will get you started on the right \\r\\nfoot. Meanwhile let my vorigaunt friend here give you a jolt to get going.\\r\\n(The vorigaunt charges up the HEV suit)\\r\\nVorigaunt-That is all we can spare.\\r\\nCitizen 2-Be careful now, we REALLY cant afford to get noticed.  Civil \\r\\nprotection catches you down here, its bad news for the whole railroad.\\r\\nVorigaunt-We serve the same mystery.\\r\\nCitizen 2-Get outta here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to find his way through the sewers and slums of city 17, he \\r\\ncomes upon a combine soldier killing a resistance member)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Wait. what are you.. no.. please.. dont shoot! Ahhh!\\r\\n(The radio in the underground railroad station is going)\\r\\nWoman on radio-Station 12 come in. Station 12 do you read?\\r\\nMan on radio-This is station 8! We heard 12 go down and out! Surgical strike \\r\\nunits are targeting the railway stations! Repeat Civil Protection is coming\\r\\ndown on the stations! We are already getting refuges from 9 and outlying,\\r\\nlooks like..(static)\\r\\nWoman on radio-Station 8 do you copy? Station 8 are you there? We have\\r\\nconfirmed reports of manhacks. Repeat they are filling the underground with \\r\\nmanhacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to battle the combine and go through the sewers, he comes\\r\\nupon a resistance member hiding in a piece of concrete pipe)\\r\\nCitizen 4-Over here! Keep going friend that station was raided but there are \\r\\nstill others up ahead. I am gonna stay here in case any others come through.  \\r\\nGotta keep the railway alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to press on through the sewers, he finds a combine patrol \\r\\nstanding on a grate above him)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 1-Anyone else get a 647-E reading?\\r\\nCivil Patrol 2-Check for miscount.\\r\\nCivil Patrol 1-Still getting that 647-E reading.\\r\\n(They see Gordon)\\r\\nCivil Patrol 3-There he is!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon escapes through the sewer tunnel and heads on, he comes across another \\r\\nresistance station)\\r\\nCitizen 5-Get in here, hurry! Civil protection is on to us. We are tearing up \\r\\nthe railroad, covering up our tracks. Looks like you are going to be the last \\r\\none through. Be glad you are not the guy they are looking for. Poor bastard \\r\\ndoes not stand a chance. Sounds like they are calling in every CP unit in \\r\\ncity 17. Now they are flooding the areas up ahead with manhacks. You better \\r\\nget going before they sweep through here\\r\\n(The citizen opens the viewing slot on the door and is greeted with the site\\r\\nof several manhacks flying towards him)\\r\\nCitizen 5-Oh shit!\\r\\n(The citizen grabs a pipe and tries to defend himself, Gordon and the citizen \\r\\ndestroy all the manhacks)\\r\\nCitizen 5-Thanks for your help.  Look it isnt safe here, I will give you some \\r\\nsupplies to get you going but then you have to leave.  Good luck out there!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to press on into the sewers, he comes to another resistance \\r\\nstation)\\r\\nCitizen 6-Hey! You are Freeman arent you? We got word that you were coming.\\r\\nYou got here at a bad time.\\r\\n(A voice comes over the radio)\\r\\nAylx-Black Mesa East to station 6 do you read? Dr. Freeman is on his way \\r\\ndownriver. Lend him the airboat and give him all the help you can. Repeat \\r\\nGordon Freeman has returned, it is critical he reaches Black Mesa East.\\r\\nCitizen 6-You better get going now.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon freeman heads on past the station, the area up ahead is being hit with \\r\\nartillery shells filled with headcrabs, he reached a small shelter with a \\r\\nairboat and another citizen)\\r\\nCitizen 7-Hey, Dr. Freeman I had been hoping you would show up, got this\\r\\nairboat all gassed up and ready to go. Its gonna be tough dodging civil \\r\\nprotection out there in the open, but drive hard and you will make it. You will \\r\\nfind more help at station 7, just up the river, its the red barn. Climb on in, \\r\\nand fire her up. You had better get going now!\\r\\n(Gordon drives the airboat out of the shelter and out of city 17 and into the \\r\\nriver)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2d. Water Hazard\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues his way down the river and he comes upon a citizen on a \\r\\nbridge above him)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Hey! You down there! Supplies!\\r\\n(The citizen throws down some supply crates)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Look out below!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues on, he reaches a closed floodgate, he goes inside the\\r\\nbuilding and inside he sees Dr. Breen on a monitor)\\r\\nDr. Breen-We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who \\r\\nhas acquired an almost meesianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens.\\r\\nHis figure is synonymous with the darkest urges of instinct, ignorance, and \\r\\ndecay. Some of the worst excesses of the Black Mesa incident have been laid \\r\\ndirectly at his feet. And yet unsophisticated minds continue to imbue him with \\r\\nromantic power. Giving him such labels as, the one free man, or the opener of \\r\\nthe way. Let me remind all citizens of the dangers of magical thinking.  \\r\\nWe have scarcely begun to climb from the dark pit of our the evolution of our \\r\\nspecies.  Let us not slide backward into oblivion, just as we have finally \\r\\nbegun to see the light. If you see this so called free-man, report him.\\r\\nCivic deeds do not go un-rewarded and likewise complicity with his cause will \\r\\nnot go un-punished. Be wise. Be safe. Be aware.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues on and opens the flood gate, and passes further down the \\r\\nriver, after eluding a chopper, he comes upon a resistance outpost with two \\r\\ncitizens and a vorigaunt.)\\r\\nCitizen 2-Hey! You are freeman arent you?\\r\\nCitizen 3-Well! I wouldnt believe it if I couldnt see it with my own eyes. \\r\\nDr. Gordon Freeman himself!\\r\\nCitizen 2-You are just in time doc, we have gotta move out before the combine \\r\\npicks us up, we are getting ready to pull out.\\r\\nCitizen 3-We better hurry, we have to tear down this camp before the combine \\r\\ngets here.\\r\\nVorigaunt-Greetings to the Freeman.\\r\\nCitizen 3-Come on in, I will show you what you are up against.\\r\\n(The citizen leads Gordon into a room with a map and radio)\\r\\n Citizen 3-Here take a look at this. This here is the dam just up ahead.\\r\\n(The citizen points to the map)\\r\\nCitizen 3-The hideout is here, a stones throw away from the apron and nestled\\r\\nin the old hydro plant. But getting there, with that hunter chopper on\\r\\nyour ass, next to impossible.  Good news is, the vorigaunt is working his magic \\r\\non your airboat, so you will have a little more firepower going forward. I \\r\\nthink he is just finishing up now. Go on out.\\r\\n(Gordon goes back to the dock and checks on the airboat, it now has a gun \\r\\nmounted on it)\\r\\nCitizen 3-There we are. That gun came off of one of the same hunter choppers \\r\\nthat you are up against. I always like to bring a little irony to a firefight.\\r\\nVoriagunt-The freeman will accept this weapon, or suffer greatly on the road \\r\\nahead.\\r\\nCitizen 3-Farwell Dr. Freeman.\\r\\nVorigaunt-For Freedom!\\r\\nCitizen 2-Give them hell doc.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon leaves the outpost, just as he gets to the hideout the flood gate \\r\\ncloses and he has to shoot down the chopper)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2e. Black Mesa East\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon passes through the dam and finally reaches the hideout, he enters a \\r\\nchamber but it is sealed and some alarms go off)\\r\\nJudith-We have got something. Okay, its human. Hello? Take it easy in there \\r\\nyou are safe now.  You will have to forgive the scanning process we cant \\r\\ntake any chances.\\r\\n(Some machines begin to run a series of scans on Gordon)\\r\\nJudith-Dr. Freeman? Gordon Freeman?! Is that you? You made it here this \\r\\nquickly? Well is Eli is going to be amazed, not to mention relieved. \\r\\nI am Dr. Mossman, Dr. Judith Mossman. I have been hearing about you since long \\r\\nbefore the Black Mesa incident. Oh! Black Mesa. I do so envy you working with \\r\\nEli and Dr. Kliener when they were at the top of their field. Ah! There we go \\r\\nyou can come through now.\\r\\n(The scanners stop and turn off and the door in front of Gordon opens)\\r\\n\\r\\nJudith-I will take you down to Eli right away. He would never forgive me if I \\r\\nkept you waiting.\\r\\n(Judith leads Gordon down through the facility)\\r\\nJudith-We could certainly use the extra help around here. We have covered a \\r\\nlot of ground in the last few months, but things would go much more faster if \\r\\nwe had more people with your training. We are closing in on a reliable local\\r\\nteleport technology, something even the combine has not mastered. Eli thinks \\r\\ntheir portals are string based, similar to our Calabi-Yau model, but they have \\r\\nfailed to factor in the dark energy equations. They can tunnel through from \\r\\ntheir universe, but once they are here they are dependent on local \\r\\ntransportation. If they knew what we were doing with entanglement...\\r\\n(Judith gets into an elevator and Gordon follows)\\r\\nJudith-Oh listen to me, I sound like a post-doc. I am just so excited to think\\r\\nthat we will finally get the chance to work together.\\r\\n(The elevator goes down)\\r\\nJudith-Were was I? Oh yes, Dr. Kliener compressed the xen relay far beyond \\r\\nanything he imagined at Black Mesa. We figured out how to use xen as an \\r\\nunexpressed axis, effectively a dimensional slingshot so we can swing around \\r\\nthe borderworld and come back in local space without having to pass through.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The elevator reaches the bottom floor)\\r\\nJudith-Oh! Here is Eli now.\\r\\n(Eli is speaking to a vorigaunt)\\r\\nEli-Alright good you keep right on it.\\r\\nJudith-Eli! Look who I found in the airlock.\\r\\nEli-Gordon Freeman! Let me get a look at you man! My god man you havent\\r\\nchanged one iota. How do you do it? Now lets see the last time I saw you,\\r\\nI sent you up for help after the resonance cascade. I never thought it\\r\\nwould take you this long to get back to me. Welcome to the lab anyway,\\r\\nits not Black Mesa but it serves us well enough.\\r\\nJudith-Its going to be a lot more like Black Mesa with Gordon here to help.\\r\\nEli-Right you are, M.I.T. graduates are few and far between these days. \\r\\nWe will get you out of that hazard suit and back into your lab coat where you\\r\\nbelong.\\r\\nJudith-Lemme just finish up some work and I will see what I can dig up.\\r\\nDr. Freeman? It has been a real honor. I am looking forward to working \\r\\ntogether.\\r\\nEli-Feel free to look around.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Eli goes back to his business, after a short while Alyx walks in)\\r\\nAlyx-Ah! Gordon, the vorigaunts said you were here. I cannot believe\\r\\nyou made it so quickly on foot.\\r\\nEli-I believe he broke your record honey.\\r\\nAlyx-Well he earned it. I guess you proved you can handle yourself out there.\\r\\nEli-There is nothing Gordon cannot handle..with the possible exception of you.\\r\\nAlyx-Dad!\\r\\nEli-Haaaa\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx goes and works on one of the machines while Eli activates a display\\r\\nfor Gordon to look at)\\r\\nEli-Take a look at this Gordon.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Judith comes out of the room she was working in)\\r\\nJudith-Alyx I though you were on watch?\\r\\nAlyx-The vorigaunts relieved me show I could come see Gordon. \\r\\nAnyway I should be in here working on the portal.\\r\\nJudith-I have the repairs well in hand. Someone misjudged the capacity\\r\\nof the combine thyristor..\\r\\nAlyx-Are you blaming me?\\r\\nJudith-No it was a calculation error not a mechanical problem.\\r\\nAlyx-Then maybe you should let me do the calculations next time, as well as\\r\\nthe installing.\\r\\nJudith-Alyx really, sometimes I think you deliberately misunderstand me.\\r\\nEli-Ahem. Alyx why dont you take Gordon and show him the gravity gun.\\r\\nAlyx-Sure, come on Gordon, lets go have some fun.\\r\\nJudith-The zero point field energy manipulator is not a toy Alyx\\r\\nAylx-Lets get out of here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx opens up a door with keypad and leads Gordon down a hallway)\\r\\nAylx-So I seen you met Dr. Mossman, she is one of the main reasons\\r\\nI spend so much time outside. You should hear her drone on about how it\\r\\nshould have been her in the Black Mesa test chamber that day. I am sorry\\r\\nI shouldnt be talking behind her back, it just gets a bit cluastraphobic\\r\\ndown here.\\r\\n(Alyx points down a hallway)\\r\\nAlyx-Thats the old passage to Ravenholm. We dont go there anymore.\\r\\nCome on.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx leads Gordon through another airlock into an area outside)\\r\\nAlyx-So here we are, the scrapyard. This is the gravity gun my father was \\r\\ntalking about, you can call it the zero point energy field manipulator if you \\r\\nreally want to.\\r\\n(Alyx opens a glass case and hands Gordon the gravity gun)\\r\\nAlyx-Its designed for handling hazardous materials, but we mainly use it for\\r\\nheavy lifting. Give it a try. The primary trigger emits a charge, you can punt\\r\\nstuff and send it flying. I found it handy for clearing minefields. The \\r\\nsecondary trigger lets you grab things, you can send them flying with the \\r\\nprimary. Once you have picked something up, you can drop it gently by pressing\\r\\nyour secondary trigger again. Pick up some stuff and toss it. You can also \\r\\npull stuff over from a distance. Try grabbing those barrels from that ledge up \\r\\nthere. All right.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx leads Gordon into the scrapyard)\\r\\nAlyx-Now let me call dog, he loves to play fetch. \\r\\nDog! Come!\\r\\n(A large robot comes out of a metal shack on the other side of the scrapyard)\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon this is dog, my dad built him to protect me when I was a kid. \\r\\nFirst model way about yay-high I have been adding to him ever since.\\r\\nOk dog lets play catch with Gordon. You will need to use the gravity gun.\\r\\nGo ahead dog. Throw!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Dog throws a series of crates as Gordon catches them with the gravity gun)\\r\\nAlyx-Dog, go get your ball!\\r\\n(Dog runs over to a metal crate and removes a round glowing object, he throws \\r\\nthis object back and forth with Gordon)\\r\\nAlyx-When I told you that you would be playing fetch, I didnt tell you who \\r\\nwould be fetching did I.\\r\\n(This continues for a short while)\\r\\nAlyx-Ok Gordon lets try something else. Throw something bigger dog.\\r\\n(Dog runs over and picks up a dumpster)\\r\\nAlyx-No Dog! No boy put that down! What is it dog?\\r\\n(A explosion can be heard)\\r\\nAlyx-Oh my god what was that? Scanners! The combine is sweeping the area!\\r\\nWe have to head back to the lab come on Gordon!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon follows Alyx back to the airlock along with dog, Alyx contacts Eli \\r\\nover the monitor)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad its Alyx are you there?\\r\\nEli-Alyx.. Honey\\r\\nAylx-Whats going on in there?\\r\\nEli-Where are you Alyx?\\r\\nAlyx-We are in the scrapyard airlock stuck in a full autocycle.\\r\\nEli-Is Gordon still with you?\\r\\nAlyx-He is right here.\\r\\nEli-Good, I want you two to..\\r\\n(The power shuts off)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad?\\r\\n(The power comes back on)\\r\\nEli-Take Gordon out of here, head for the coast! Do not go through raven..\\r\\n(The monitor cuts off)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad? Dad! Damn it! Dog open the airlock get us out of here! Hurry now!\\r\\nTear it apart if you have to, just get it open! Thats enough dog. Come on\\r\\nGordon! Come on!\\r\\n\\r\\n(As Alyx and Gordon run back to the lab a pile of rocks collapses separating\\r\\nGordon from Alyx, a firefight can be heard taking place, she speaks to him \\r\\nthrough a hole in the rubble)\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon you need to get out of here, I cant leave my father. Dog, take \\r\\nGordon to the Ravenholm tunnel, then circle around and try to meet up with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon follows dog down the hallway Alyx pointed out earlier, Dog opens up\\r\\na tunnel door and Gordon continues on alone)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2f. We Dont Go To Ravenholm\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon fights his way through Ravenholm, a horrid abandoned town infested \\r\\nwith headcrabs and zombies, after a short while he hears a mans voice)\\r\\nFather Gregori-For it was said that they had become like those peculiar demons\\r\\nwhich dwell in matter, but in which no light may be found.\\r\\nFather Gregori-For the days of my life have vanished like smoke, and my bones\\r\\nare parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as fuel for that fire\\r\\nuntil nothing remains but the light alone.\\r\\nFather Gregori-May they become like dust before the wind, may the angel of \\r\\nthe lord pursue them.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes upon a burning yard with several zombies coming at him on fire,\\r\\na man kicks open the door at the top of the yard and kills the zombies with \\r\\na shotgun)\\r\\nFather Gregori-But whos is this? Another life to save? I will keep my eye on\\r\\nyou, more than that I cannot promise.\\r\\n(The man heads back into the door)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to fight his way through Ravenholm when he sees the man \\r\\nagain)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Well done brother. Make free us of my traps. But take care\\r\\nnot to fall in them yourself. Behind you!\\r\\n(Father Gregori shoots a zombie behind Gordon)\\r\\nFather Gregori-In Ravenholm, you do well to be vigilant.\\r\\n(Father Gregori walks away and Gordon continues to move forward)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After a short time Gordon sees him again)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Better and Better! I am Father Gregori, you have already met \\r\\nmy, congregation, aha aha ahaaa!\\r\\n(Father Gregori walks away again and Gordon moves on)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After some time Gordon again sees Father Gregori shooting at some zombies)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Ah! It is you brother! I apologize, but no harm done. My \\r\\nbullets are the least of your concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\n(In the same area Gordon sees him again)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Although they call me crazy I care not, for thou art my helper\\r\\nmy strength, and my savior.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon sees the man soon again on a ledge above him)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Here brother! Come closer. You have stirred up hell!\\r\\nA man after my own heart! Here I have a more suitable gun for you. You will\\r\\nneed it. Catch!\\r\\n(Father Gregori throws Gordon a shotgun)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Good, now keep it close. My advice to you is..aim for the head.\\r\\nHush!\\r\\n(The sound of claws clinking on metal can be heard, the drain pipe in front of\\r\\nGordon begins to shake)\\r\\nFather Gregori-They come! There is no rest in Ravenholm! Move on and I will\\r\\nmeet you at the church.\\r\\n\\r\\n(After Gordon and Father Gregori fight off the aliens, Gordon moves on\\r\\nand sees him again)\\r\\nFather Gregori-How came you here brother? This is the wrong side of town\\r\\nfor you! Did I not tell you to seek the church? Mend your ways before it is\\r\\ntoo late!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues on, as he emerges from a roof hatch he sees Father Gregori\\r\\non the other side of a fence, behind him is the church)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Ah, there you are! At last! I will send the cart for you\\r\\nbrother! It will be but a moment! Patience brother! Guard yourself well!\\r\\n(Father Gregori goes and activates the tiny gondola to the church, while\\r\\nGordon is waiting for it to arrive a swarm of aliens attacks him)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Almost there brother!\\r\\n(The gondola arrives)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Now brother step into the cart! The handbrake brother release \\r\\nit and come down!\\r\\n(Gordon rides the gondola across the fence and into the church area)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Greetings brother! And so we meet at last. You are to be\\r\\ncommended for avoiding my traps. The work of a man who once had too much time\\r\\non his hands, and now finds time for nothing but the work of salvation.\\r\\nI suspect you have little wish to remain in Ravenholm, so I will show you to\\r\\nthe mines. As for me..A shepherd must tend to his flock... Especially when\\r\\nthey have grown unruly. Follow me brother, and tread lightly, for this is\\r\\nhallowed ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon and Father Gregori fight their way past the area behind the church,\\r\\nand past a graveyard to the mine entrance)\\r\\nFather Gregori-Farwell brother! I fear I deliver you to a darker place.\\r\\nMay the light of lights be with you. Look to your own, salvation.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Father Gregori runs off to kill some zombies, and Gordon heads into the \\r\\nmines, Gordon finally makes his way out of the mines, and emerges onto some\\r\\ntrain tracks, there are combine snipers here, after killing them he finds a\\r\\nfirefight going on between resistance members and the combine, he jumps in\\r\\nand helps, after this is over the citizens survey the damage)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen 1-Who is hurt?\\r\\nCitizen 2-Winston has been hit.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Patch him up and get him to the back as soon as he is stable.\\r\\n(He notices Gordon)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Gordon Freeman? Its incredible you made it! We have been getting\\r\\ncommunications from Alyx. I will see if I can reach her again. Follow me.\\r\\n(He leads Gordon to a door, then knocks on it)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Its Leon, we are all clear. And I have got Gordon Freeman!\\r\\n(The door opens)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Dr. Freeman you are kidding? I have been on the line with Alyx.\\r\\nHer father has been captured.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Over here Dr. Freeman.\\r\\nVorigaunt-The Eli Vance is indispensable to the liberation.\\r\\n(The citizen leads Gordon to a monitor, he tunes it and Alyx appears)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Alyx its Leon, and I have got Gordon Freeman with me.\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon! You made it through Ravenholm? Thank god! I need your help!\\r\\nThey have taken my father! He has been taken to Nova Prospekt. The vorigaunts\\r\\ntracked the ship that made off with him and Judith Mossman. While the trains\\r\\nare still running I am going to hitch a ride. Here is where you come in\\r\\nGordon. I need you to make your way along the coast until you get to\\r\\nNova Prospekt. It used to be a high security prison, its something much\\r\\nworse than that now. But I think it is still easier to sneak in than to\\r\\nbreak out.\\r\\nCitizen 1-You want him to take the coast road? He wont last five minutes on\\r\\nfoot. Its antlion spawning season.\\r\\nAlyx-Thats why I called you Leon. I was hoping you still had the scout car we\\r\\nleft with you last summer. The one my dad rigged with the tau cannon.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Yeah good idea, hold on a sec.\\r\\n(The citizen tunes the radio again)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Noriko? Bring the buggy out put it on the dock right now, Gordon\\r\\nFreeman will be driving it!\\r\\nCitizen on radio-Will do! I just finished mounting an ammo crate on the back.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Good timing. Ok Alyx we are all set.\\r\\nAlyx-Thanks Leon. Gordon I have not driven the coast in over a year, but I\\r\\nhave no reason to think its gotten any safer. Meet me in the depot where the\\r\\ntrains unload. Take care of yourself and I will see you in Nova Prospekt.\\r\\nCitizen 1-Bye Alyx. Ok doc, before you hit the road you might wanna grab some\\r\\nmedkits, restock on ammo, maybe check the map see where you are headed. There\\r\\nis an ammo supply crate on the back of the car if that is any comfort. Stay\\r\\nwith the car, make use of the thumpers, and you will stand a fair chance\\r\\nagainst the antlions. I will radio ahead to let the next base know you are\\r\\ncoming.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon heads out to the dock where the car is waiting)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2g. Highway 17\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(As Gordon comes out onto the dock he can see the car waiting for him,\\r\\nand a large crane with a magnet on it)\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizen in crane-Hello Dr. Freeman, the car is all ready for you. Hop in and\\r\\nI will lower you down to the beach! Good here we go!\\r\\n(The citizen in the crane begins to lower Gordon and the car down to the\\r\\nbeach)\\r\\nCitizen in crane-Damn magnet is failing! Hold on!\\r\\n(The car falls to the beach upside down)\\r\\nCitizen in crane-Sorry doc!\\r\\n(Gordon rights the car with the gravity gun a drives off)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After a while Gordon comes to another resistance outpost)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Gordon Freeman! Hurry get in the basement! We are expecting\\r\\ngunships at any moment. Colonel Cubbage will be glad to see you made it.\\r\\n(Gordon heads down into the basement of the building where a man is \\r\\nspeaking to some other resistance members)\\r\\nColonel Cubbage-This steerable rocket launcher is our best bet for taking\\r\\ndown a gunship. Ah! Hello, I will be right with you. Now.. where was I? \\r\\nAh yes.. Using the laser guide, you can steer you rocket past the gunship\\r\\ndefenses and prevent it from shooting down your rocket. This will only anger\\r\\nit at first. But if you can survive long enough to make several direct hits,\\r\\nyou will be rewarded with a prize worthy of any mantle piece. Now? Who is\\r\\ngoing to be the lucky one to carry it into combat? Ah yes Gordon Freeman.\\r\\nI could not have asked for a finer volunteer.\\r\\n(Gordon takes the RPG)\\r\\nColonel Cubbage-Colonel Odessa Cubbage at your service.\\r\\n\\r\\n(An alarm begins to sound)\\r\\nCitizen 2-Gunship!\\r\\nColonel Cubbage-Damn! Let me just send a warning to lighthouse point, then I\\r\\nwill come right up and lend a hand!\\r\\n(Gordon goes outside and shoots down the gunship, he goes back down to the\\r\\nbasement)\\r\\nColonel Cubbage-Well thats that. I gather you have disposed of that gunship\\r\\nDr. Freeman, your reputation is well deserved. I will have someone open the\\r\\ngate for you immediately.\\r\\n(Gordon goes outside, a citizen opens the gate for him and he drives off)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2h. Sandtraps\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(After driving for a very long time, Gordon comes to a resistance outpost\\r\\nstationed at a lighthouse)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Hey over here! You made it! We are picking up radio chatter,\\r\\nthey are looking for your car. Get you car in the garage.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon drives his car into the garage and leaves it there, as this is\\r\\nhis destination)\\r\\nCitizen 1-Ok doc you will have to go on foot from here. There is a secret\\r\\npath along the cliffside, but no one is going anywhere until we fight off \\r\\nthis attack. Having you here to fight alongside us is going to make a big\\r\\ndifference for morale. Oh crap! Here come the dropships!\\r\\n(Gordon fights off the combine along with the resistance members, after the\\r\\nbattle one of them comes up and shows Gordon the way down the path)\\r\\nCitizen 2-This way Dr. Freeman, we will take the cliff path before the\\r\\ngunships find us. Right along there, and watch your step.\\r\\n(The secret door opens up and Gordon goes on foot down the path along\\r\\nthe edge of the cliff)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After a short while Gordon comes to a citizen and his friend\\r\\nlaying injured on a rock in the middle of the sand)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Hey you there! Dont move! Stay on the rocks! Stepping on the sand\\r\\nmakes the antlions crazy!\\r\\n(The injured citizen begins to get up)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Lazlo dont move!\\r\\n(The antlions crawl up from the sand and kill the injured citizen)\\r\\nCitizen 3-Dear god! Poor Lazlo. The finest mind of his generation come to\\r\\nsuch an end. You go on. There is nothing else you can do here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues on across the beach when he comes upon a very large\\r\\nantlion he kills it, and a vorigaunt emerges from a nearby outpost)\\r\\nVorigaunt-The freeman would be wise to heed out extraction of the \\r\\nmyrmadonts aromatic pheropods, the process is not entirely hygienic so\\r\\nplease, stand aside.\\r\\n(The vorigaunt harvests the bugbait from the corpse of the super antlion)\\r\\nVorigaunt-The freeman will have need of these on the road ahead. Gather them\\r\\nnow.\\r\\n(The vorigaunt leads Gordon back into the outpost and gives him some simple\\r\\ntraining on how to use the bugbait, he then raises a barrier and lets Gordon\\r\\nleave)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon fights his way up the beach with the antlions helping him,\\r\\nafter a while he finally reaches Nova Prospekt)\\r\\n \\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2i. Nova Prospekt\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon continues to fight his way on through Nova Prospekt with his army\\r\\nof antlions)\\r\\n\\r\\nNo dialogue in this level\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2j. Entanglement\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(Gordon finally meets up with Alyx after a short while, unfortunately he has \\r\\nlost control of the antlions and can no longer herd them)\\r\\nAlyx-I am glad you made it here in one piece. My dad is up there somewhere, in\\r\\nthat holding area. Its gonna take some doing to get him out. Lets get out of\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon follows her down an elevator)\\r\\nAlyx-I am afraid that I am flying blind here. Every now and then a vorigaunt\\r\\ngets captured and sends back a little picture of this place. What we do know,\\r\\nis all bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon fights his way along with Alyx and they come to a control room, she\\r\\nfinds her dad and they go after him, they come to the holding room where he is)\\r\\nAlyx-There he is!\\r\\nEli-Alyx! Gordon! Is that really you? I cant believe you found me!\\r\\nAlyx-Dad are you alright?!\\r\\nEli-Im fine but you have to get out of here.\\r\\nAlyx-We are here to get you out dad!\\r\\nEli-Nevermind me save yourselves!\\r\\nAylx-No we are not leaving you! I think I can recalibrate the combine portal\\r\\nto get us out of here.\\r\\nEli-But where will you go?\\r\\nAlyx-I talked to Dr. Kliener, his portal was almost working again. If he has\\r\\nmanaged to repair it then we will end up there. If he hasnt well... we would\\r\\nnot be any worse off.\\r\\nEli-Its not worth the risk honey! I cant lost you! Get out while you still \\r\\ncan!\\r\\nAlyx-We are not leaving here without you, thats final!\\r\\nEli-We cant leave without Judith either.\\r\\nAlyx-Dont worry dad we will find her. For now I am going to send you to the\\r\\nteleport room. I am not saying goodbye dad. We will meet you there.\\r\\nEli-I know you will honey.\\r\\n(Alyx uses the controls to send the pod Eli is in to the teleport room)\\r\\nAylx-Lets get out of here. I am going to head back to the security station\\r\\nand try to patch into your suit radio.\\r\\n(Alyx goes back while Gordon heads forward)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx speaks through the suit)\\r\\nAlyx-Hey it worked, lets see what I can do to clear the way for you, keep an\\r\\neye out for Mossman. I will get my dad through the prison as far as I can then\\r\\nI will catch up to you.\\r\\n(Gordon comes to a closed gate)\\r\\nAlyx-Hang on I will get that gate open.\\r\\n(The gate opens)\\r\\n(Gordon comes to another closed gate)\\r\\nAlyx-Damn! It is jammed ok I have got an idea, head back to that office.\\r\\n(Gordon goes back and finds a vent he goes through)\\r\\nAlyx-Be careful Gordon I am picking up a lot of soldiers ahead.\\r\\n(Gordon comes to another gate)\\r\\nAlyx-I will start working on this gate, hang on.\\r\\n(Gordon moves on)\\r\\nAlyx-You are coming up to another control room, looks like it is still\\r\\noccupied.\\r\\n(Gordon clears the room)\\r\\nAlyx-My guess is that there are a bunch more soldiers heading your way.\\r\\nQuick search the room. There should be some combine turrets nearby. I can\\r\\nreprogram these turrets to attack the enemy. You set them up to defend the\\r\\ncontrol room. I cant shut down those fields from here. I am going to have to \\r\\ncatch up with you to access them. I am picking up a lot of incoming soldiers,\\r\\nhold the fort until I get there.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon defends the room until Alyx falls down out of a vent in the ceiling)\\r\\nAlyx-Sorry it took me so long. Glad to see you are okay. Lets see if we can\\r\\nfind Mossman. It looks like this station might give me better access.\\r\\n(Alyx scrolls through some cameras and finds her)\\r\\nAlyx-There she is. Wait a minute. How did she..?\\r\\n(Mossman is talking to Dr. Breen)\\r\\nBreen-...from your area\\r\\nJudith-I am not calling about that, you promised you were not going to touch\\r\\nEli\\r\\nAlyx-What is she up to? Oh my god.\\r\\nBreen-The soldiers were a bit overzealous I admit, but he was too tempting\\r\\na prize to turn loose, especially in the absence of Gordon Freeman.\\r\\nJudith-You would have had Freeman if you had just been patient and waited\\r\\nfor my signal.</pre><pre id=\\\"faqspan-2\\\">\\r\\nBreen-We were not entirely sure you were ever going to get around to that,\\r\\nhuman loyalties being what they are.\\r\\nJudith-Dr. Breen, as I have stated before you have to let Eli come around\\r\\non his own, you cannot just..\\r\\nBreen-I have known Dr. Vance far longer than you my dear. I am afraid your\\r\\nfeelings for him might have blinded you.\\r\\nJudith-Feelings?  This has nothing to do with feelings. It is a simple truth\\r\\nthat when Eli believes in our..\\r\\nBreen-This is not open to debate Dr. Mossman.\\r\\nJudith-Doctor please..\\r\\nBreen-So sorry Judith I am all out of time.\\r\\n(The monitor shuts off)\\r\\nAlyx-Damn her! I dont believe this! Come on Gordon now we really have to\\r\\nhurry. Go on ahead I will disrupt the next level of security and will catch\\r\\nup to you when I can.\\r\\n(Gordon goes on ahead)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to a room with 3 turrets in it)\\r\\nAlyx-Quick get these set up, I see soldiers coming in from all directions.\\r\\n(Gordon sets up the turrets)\\r\\nAlyx-Here they come!\\r\\n(After a while of fighting of soldiers, Alyx talks to Gordon again)\\r\\nAlyx-Ok Gordon I am going to leave off here and catch up with you. be there as\\r\\nsoon as I can.\\r\\n(Alyx jumps down from a balcony above)\\r\\nAlyx-Sorry to take so long Gordon, I wont leave you again, now, lets go\\r\\ntrack down Mossman.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx and Gordon head off to find Mossman, after a short distance they come to\\r\\na hallway, all the lights are shut off one by one)\\r\\nAlyx-uh-oh\\r\\n(A horde of Combine soldiers pour in, Gordon and Alyx fight them off and head\\r\\non)\\r\\n\\r\\n(They come to a control room)\\r\\nAlyx-Great another security station.\\r\\n(Alyx uses her hacking tool to hack the security station)\\r\\nAlyx-Alright Mossman where are you...\\r\\n(The monitor cycles to a image of Judith in a control room)\\r\\nAlyx-Ha! There you are!\\r\\n(Alyx inputs some commands and seals off the station that Judith is at)\\r\\nAlyx-Ha! Got you now! Well come on Gordon we dont want to keep her waiting.\\r\\n(They head to the next room, combine soldiers come out of a field gate)\\r\\nAlyx-Come on Gordon! Let me seal this door. No turning back now.\\r\\n\\r\\n(They run up to a window and see Judith inside)\\r\\nAylx-There she is. Leave the talking to me Gordon. We may need her to get\\r\\nout of here.\\r\\n(Alyx goes and bangs on the window)\\r\\nJudith-Hello? Oh thank god.. Someone is here. Alyx? Gordon? How did you get in\\r\\nhere?\\r\\nAylx-We know all about you and Breen. You have been a spy for the combine the \\r\\nwhole time.\\r\\nJudith-What? What are you talking about?\\r\\n(The sealed door begins to give way under the combine battery)\\r\\nAlyx-Dammit, move back Mossman we are coming in.\\r\\n(Alyx opens the door to the room)\\r\\nJudith-Alyx whatever you may think I assure you I am working to protect your\\r\\nfather.\\r\\nAylx-Shut up and be glad you are still of some use to us! We are going to \\r\\nreconfigure this teleport and get the hell out of here.\\r\\nJudith-You see we are working to the same end. I have already modulated the\\r\\nteleporter to emulate a xen relay.\\r\\nAylx-That is my fathers work you stole!\\r\\nJudith-Its my work to! And I had to prove to Dr. Breen that your father \\r\\nwould be the most valuable member of any research effort going forward from \\r\\nhere.\\r\\nAlyx-Enough of your bullshit!\\r\\n(The monitor shows Eli)\\r\\nAlyx-Look Gordon there is my dad, I am going to bring him in.\\r\\nJudith-You found Eli?\\r\\nAlyx-No thanks to you! Just enter the coordinates for Dr. Klieners lab and\\r\\nlets get moving.\\r\\nJudith-But we need access to the teleport platform and we are locked out.\\r\\nAlyx-I will take care of that.\\r\\n(The door to the teleport room opens)\\r\\nAlyx-Lets get going.\\r\\n\\r\\n(They all head into the teleport room which contains a teleport similar to the\\r\\none in Dr. Klieners lab but it is much taller)\\r\\nAylx-Oh my god. And you have been working with this thing? For how long?\\r\\nJudith-Never.. Until now. Though I did have a fairly good idea of what to\\r\\nexpect.\\r\\n(Eli comes in on the prison pod)\\r\\nAylx-I bet you did. It looks like it is waiting for us.\\r\\nJudith-The combine use a peculiar pulse-forming network with a very long\\r\\nrise time, It takes quite a while to recharge.\\r\\nAlyx-So you have warmed it up for us. Good. And just in time.\\r\\n(The prison pod opens)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad down here. Sorry we took so long I hope that was not too bad for you.\\r\\nEli-Do not worry about me sweetheart. Judith! I see they set you free!\\r\\nAylx-Not exactly.\\r\\nJudith-Eli! I was so worried about you!\\r\\nAlyx-The coordinates Dr. Mossman.\\r\\n(A large bang is heard at the sealed door)\\r\\nEli-So this is the combine portal, It is smaller than I imagined.\\r\\n(Eli is moved into the portal)\\r\\nAlyx-Hurry up Mossman!\\r\\n(Alyx contacts Dr. Kliener over the terminal)\\r\\nAylx-Dr. Kleiner!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Yes Alyx where are you?\\r\\nAlyx-We are in Nova Prospekt, and we are running the Xen emulation for the\\r\\nfirst time. Are you ready for us?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Ready! Willing! And fully enabled!\\r\\nAlyx-Good we will send my dad through first, he is in position for...\\r\\n(An alarm sounds)\\r\\nAylx-What was that? Hold on gotta bring this back down.\\r\\n(Mossman sneaks into the portal and starts it)\\r\\nAlyx-No! Stop! What are you doing!\\r\\nJudith-I am sorry Alyx, it is the only way.\\r\\nAlyx-No! Get back here!\\r\\nEli-Whats going on Alyx? Judith?\\r\\n(The portal starts to rise, as Alyx tries to stop it, it activates)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener you have to stop them!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Stop who my dear?\\r\\nAlyx-Oh my god! What coordinates are these? Where did she take him!\\r\\n(Another large bang is heard at the door)\\r\\nAlyx-No.. Cover me Gordon I have to reset the portal. Use the turrets!\\r\\n(A series of several bangs can be heard, the doors to the room finally\\r\\n are blown open by the combine, Gordon and alyx fight them off until the\\r\\nportal is ready)\\r\\nAlyx-Thank god it is done lets get the hell out of here!\\r\\n(Alyx and Gordon run into the portal, as it begins to raise the remaining\\r\\ndoors to the room blow open and soldiers flood out, the building begins to\\r\\ncollapse, just as a large cement piece is about to fall on the portal\\r\\nthey are teleported and the screen goes white)\\r\\n\\r\\n(The screen fades back in to reveal the room in Dr. Klieners lab with the\\r\\nteleporter in it)\\r\\nAlyx-My god we made it! But where is Dr. Kliener?\\r\\n(Alyx bangs on the secret wall)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Kliener let us out!\\r\\n(Dr. Kliener pops in with a shotgun)\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Aylx? Gordon? My god how did you get here and when?\\r\\nAlyx-What is wrong?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-My dear, I had given up hope of ever seeing you again.\\r\\nAlyx-I was thinking the same. I think the teleport exploded just as we made\\r\\nit out.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Indeed it did. And the repercussions were felt far and wide..\\r\\nbut that was over a week ago.\\r\\nAlyx-What do you mean? Gordon and I were just there a minute ago.\\r\\nDr. Kiener-Fascinating. We seem to have developed a slow teleport. This\\r\\nsuggests an entirely new line of investigation.\\r\\nAlyx-A week..? Then what have we missed?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-A great deal my dear. The blow you struck at Nova Prospekt was\\r\\ntaken as a signal to start the uprising.\\r\\nAlyx-But what about my father?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Well.. that is most disturbing. According to the vorigaunts\\r\\nhe is a prisoner at the citadel.\\r\\nAlyx-We have got to get my father out.\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Barney has been leading a push with that very aim in mind.\\r\\nAnd another of your friends arrived several days ago.\\r\\n(Dr. Kliener opens the room where the HEV suit used to be, inside is Dog)\\r\\nAlyx-Dog! You made it!\\r\\nDr. Kliener-So there. You see? Its not all hopeless.\\r\\nAlyx-I wish I shared your optimism doctor.\\r\\n(Barney appears over a monitor)\\r\\nBarney-Doc come in.. are you there?\\r\\nDr. Kliener-Yes barney and I am no longer alone. Alyx and Gordon have just\\r\\narrived.\\r\\nBarney-Well man thats good news, I almost gave you guys up for lost.\\r\\nWe are going to set up a staging area for the attack on the citadel.\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon and dog can head your way. I want to get Dr. Kliener somewhere\\r\\nsafer.\\r\\nBarney-I will take all the help I can get. Oh crap! Incoming!\\r\\n(A artillery shell flies by barney)\\r\\nBarney-Get going!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon and Dog head out of the lab and onto the streets of City 17)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\nAnti-Citizen One\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(As Gordon and Dog head out to the streets a combine tank drives up, Dog picks \\r\\nit up and throws it into a building filled with soldiers, he then pries open a\\r\\nbarricade to let Gordon past, after Gordon is past he shuts it and jumps onto\\r\\na dropship, the dropship flies off with Dog on it)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon meets up with some resistance members)\\r\\nResistance 1-Well Gordon Freeman, and about time to\\r\\nResistance 2-Gordon you are here!\\r\\nResistance 3-Dr. Freeman we are coming with you\\r\\n(They head off and continue on)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon comes to an area sealed off by twisted metal and concrete)\\r\\nResistance 4-Gordon Freeman? It is you isnt it! Give me a minute, Im gonna\\r\\nplant some charges and blow this open.\\r\\n(After holding off combine forces for some time the area is blow open)\\r\\nResistance 4-Looks nasty in there! Good thing you have that suit!\\r\\n(Gordon makes it past the area and opens the locked door)\\r\\nResistance 4-I see you made it through okay, I figured you would.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon finds a resistance member through a fence)\\r\\nResistance 5-Dr. Freeman? It is not safe here anymore. They are shelling the\\r\\nhell out of us. I will send word you are coming up ahead. Keep moving.\\r\\n(Gordon continues on with his squad)\\r\\n\\r\\n(He comes to a room with 2 turrets, after knocking them down the door blows\\r\\nopen and Alyx comes in)\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon! I had a feeling I would find you here. I have got Dr. Kliener in\\r\\na safe spot. Now we can join up with Barney. There is a command center \\r\\ndownstairs, I am hoping to find information on generator locations. Ready?\\r\\nLets go.\\r\\n(Gordon and Alyx go downstairs and reach the command center)\\r\\nAlyx-Well we are in luck, there is a generator in the square outside. We are\\r\\ntrying to disable as many as we can to loosen the combines grip on the city.\\r\\nIt will take me a few minutes to expose the core, then I will need you to hit\\r\\nit with a burst from the gravity gun. In the meantime watch my back.\\r\\n(Gordon and Alyx head outside to the plaza, Alyx starts to disable the\\r\\ngenerator)\\r\\nAlyx-This should not take too long. As soon as it is down, I will open that\\r\\ngate and we can get out of here.\\r\\n(Gordon fights off the combine forces as Alyx tries to open the generator)\\r\\nAlyx-Ok the core is exposed. Use the gravity gun Gordon!\\r\\n(Gordon uses the gravity gun to push the energy source out of the core)\\r\\nAlyx-All right, I am opening the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n(They both run through the gate and Alyx shuts it)\\r\\nAlyx-Ok, Barney should be on the far side of that...canal. Well there used to\\r\\nbe a bridge here. Let me see if I can scout a new path. Ah! Wait for me here.\\r\\n(Alyx climbs up a drain pipe to the top of a building)\\r\\nAlyx-Hey! Looks like we might be able to get through down there! Lets head\\r\\nthat way!\\r\\n(Bullets are fired at Alyx)\\r\\nAlyx-Ah! No! Gordon! Run! Get out of here!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon runs off into the sewers)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2l. Follow Freeman!\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(After getting through the sewers Gordon finds another resistance member)\\r\\nResistance 1-Dr. Freeman! Barney said you were on your way. We got split up by\\r\\nsnipers, and he is pinned down in a warehouse up ahead. Go ahead, he is\\r\\nrelying on you.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon heads past the snipers and finds a wounded resistance member in the\\r\\nbasement of the warehouse)\\r\\nResistance 2-Help! Is somebody up there? Help! Help me! We thought we would be\\r\\nsafer down here. Little did we know the place was infested. The rest of them\\r\\nheaded upstairs, took their chances with the snipers. I guess they are still\\r\\nup there.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon heads upstairs and sees Barney)\\r\\nBarney-Over here! Gordon I cant move, these snipers have got me pinned down.\\r\\nGordon lob a couple grenades, that will clear them out.\\r\\n(Gordon blows out the snipers with grenades)\\r\\nBarney-Alright, thanks Gordon, now lets clear out of here.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon and Barney head out of the building and to a security gate)\\r\\nBarney-Let me get this gate. My Civil Protection status still gives me limited\\r\\nclearance. Did you hear a cat just now? That damn thing haunts me.\\r\\n(Barney opens the gate and they both continue on)\\r\\n\\r\\n(They come to a building and some resistance members join them)\\r\\nBarney-There is an old building up ahead. A bank or museum or something like\\r\\nthat. Whatever the hell it used to be, now it is a nexus for Overwatch in\\r\\nCity 17. It is the main source of pain for this part of town, thanks to a huge\\r\\nsuppression device that rains down hell from the roof of the place.\\r\\n(They come to a window)\\r\\nBarney-There it is, the Overwatch nexus. Looks like they are mobilizing \\r\\nbig-time. You can sort of see the gate from here. I will show you when we get\\r\\nto street level. We have to get into that building to open the gate. Even then\\r\\nthe suppression device will, suppress anyone who tries to come through unless\\r\\nwe shut it down.\\r\\n(As Gordon goes into the next room a camera detects him and an alarm goes off)\\r\\nBarney-So much for stealth. We have been spotted!\\r\\n(They reach the street)\\r\\nBarney-There is the gate I was telling you about. We have to come back here\\r\\nafter we get it open. If we get it open. First we gotta get into the nexus\\r\\nbuilding.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Barney and Gordon fight past the combine and get into the building)\\r\\nBarney-Uh-oh, turrets. You have the HEV suit, you deal with them. Then I will\\r\\nopen the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Barney and Gordon fight past the combine into the building and come to a room\\r\\nwith lasers)\\r\\nBarney-Wow, with that much security there must be something good in there.\\r\\nGo for it doc. I will wait here until you shut I down.\\r\\n(Gordon gets past the lasers and shuts it down)\\r\\n\\r\\n(After disabling the final generator Barney and Gordon head for the roof)\\r\\nBarney-Ah here it is, roof access. I am going to stay here and help other\\r\\nresistance members come through.\\r\\n\\r\\n(After fighting his way up to and down from the roof Gordon finds another\\r\\nresistance member)\\r\\nResistance 3-Dr. Freeman! Since you shut off the suppressor and opened the\\r\\ngate, we can really move people through now. The combine is really going to\\r\\nfeel the squeeze! We dropped a crate of rockets across the plaza. If you can\\r\\nmake it there you can take down the striders.\\r\\n\\r\\n(After fighting his way through City 17 and past a whole mess of striders\\r\\nGordon finds Dog bursting through a barricade of cars with Barney running\\r\\nbehind him)\\r\\nBarney-Dog! Here boy! Dog come back here! Damn it all! Gordon! Hey help me\\r\\nout here!\\r\\n(They run over to the citadel wall)\\r\\nBarney-Dog came crashing through the plaza, knocking over walls, I think he\\r\\nis looking for Alyx. He seems to have it set in his mind that she is in the\\r\\ncitadel. I figured Alyx would not want him getting into any deeper trouble but\\r\\nhell, you try stopping him.\\r\\n(Dog pulls  up the citadel wall)\\r\\nBarney-Hey dog! Not there! You cannot get through that way!\\r\\n(Dog lifts it all the way up)\\r\\nBarney-Well I will be dammed. I think he wants you to go through Gordon,\\r\\nyou had better hurry.\\r\\n(Gordon jumps into the hole)\\r\\nBarney-And if you see Dr. Breen, tell him I said f--- -ou!*\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon heads down into the citadel through the underground)\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2m. Our Benefactors\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(Gordon rides along the prison pod conveyor system to get to the top of the \\r\\ncitadel, he gets the upgraded gravity gun and probably enjoys throwing some \\r\\ncombine fools around the building)\\r\\n\\r\\nNo dialogue in this level\\r\\n\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n2n. Dark Energy\\r\\n==============================================================================\\r\\n(Gordon reaches the top of the citadel in the prison pod, the guards take the\\r\\nblue gravity gun from him and Judith comes in)\\r\\nJudith-I will take him from here. Dont struggle, its no use. Until you are\\r\\nwhere he wants you there is nothing you can do. I am sorry Gordon.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Judith leads the pod into a room with Eli and Dr. Breen talking)\\r\\nDr. Breen-..ancient stars colonized by sentient fungi. Gas giants, inhabited\\r\\nby vast meteorological intelligences. Worlds stretched thin across the\\r\\nmembranes where dimensions intersect...Impossible to describe with our limited\\r\\nvocabulary!\\r\\nEli-What I have seen is also beyond words Breen. Genocide, indescribable \\r\\nevil...Good god.\\r\\nDr. Breen-Well if it isnt Gordon Freeman at last.\\r\\n(The guard shows Breen the gravity gun)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Oh what is this? Put it over there.\\r\\n(The guard puts it on the desk)\\r\\nDr. Breen-You have my gratitude Dr. Freeman, first you lead me to the doorstep\\r\\nof my oldest friend, then you deliver yourself. If I had known you were going\\r\\nto come straight up to my office I would not have bothered hunting you in the\\r\\nfirst place. Having both of you in my keeping ensures I can dictate the terms\\r\\nof any bargain I care to make with the Combine.\\r\\nJudith-Dr. Breen..Wallace..\\r\\nDr. Breen-Yes what is it Judith?\\r\\nJudith-The bargain we should be making is for his life so he can continue his\\r\\nresearch!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Thanks to you we have everything we need in that regard. You are \\r\\nmore than qualified to finish his research yourself. What neither you nor I\\r\\ncan do is convince that rabble in the streets to give up their senseless \\r\\nstruggle. Yet Eli refuses to speak the words that would save them all.\\r\\nEli-Save them?! For what?!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Eli.. If you will not do this for the good of all people, maybe\\r\\nyou will do it for one of them.\\r\\n(The mechanical arm takes Alyx out of the prison pod)\\r\\nEli-Alyx..Honey..\\r\\nAlyx-Dad! Huh.. Gordon? No..\\r\\nEli-God damn you Breen! You let her go!\\r\\nDr. Breen-That is all up to you my old friend. Will you let your stubborn\\r\\nshort sightedness doom the entire species? Or will you give your child the\\r\\nchance her mother never had?\\r\\n(Alyx spits in his face)\\r\\nAlyx-How dare you even mention her!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Alyx my dear you have your mothers eyes. But your fathers\\r\\nstubbornness.\\r\\nAlyx-You have not seen a bit of it yet.\\r\\nDr. Breen-Really? Well lets see how it serves you, on the far side of a\\r\\ncombine portal.\\r\\nEli-Go ahead Breen! If that is the worst you can do, send us through your\\r\\nportal.\\r\\nDr. Breen-Oh it is hardly the worst. But you might find that hard to believe\\r\\nonce you get there.\\r\\nJudith-It isnt necessary!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I agree it is a total waste. Fortunately the resistance has shown\\r\\nit is willing to accept a new leader. And this one has proven to be a fine\\r\\npawn for those who control him.\\r\\nEli-No!\\r\\nAlyx-Dont listen to him Gordon!\\r\\nDr. Breen-How about it Dr. Freeman? Did you realize your contract was open to\\r\\nthe highest bidder?\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon would never make any kind of deal with you!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I understand if you dont wish to discuss this in front of your\\r\\nfriends. I will send them on their way and then we can talk openly.\\r\\nEli-Dont struggle honey.\\r\\nAlyx-Dad.. Im so sorry.\\r\\nEli-Alyx..sweetheart.\\r\\n(Judith uses the hacking tool on the console)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Judith, what do you think you are doing?\\r\\nJudith-We are doing what I could never do alone. We are stopping you.\\r\\nAlyx-Yes!\\r\\n(Breen uses the intercom)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Guards! Get in here!\\r\\n(Judith uses the hacking tool on the intercom, the guards begin banging on the\\r\\ndoor)\\r\\nDr. Breen-They know you betrayed them, they will turn on you, Judith..\\r\\nDr. Mossman please!\\r\\nJudith-I am sorry Wallace, you are all out of time.\\r\\n(Judith begins using the console, Breen tries to stop her)\\r\\nJudith-Dont!\\r\\n(As Judith is freeing Gordon Breen grabs the gravity gun)\\r\\nAlyx-Hurry! Dad hang on!\\r\\nDr. Breen-You fool!\\r\\nAlyx-Watch out he is gonna..\\r\\nDr. Breen-No!\\r\\n(Breen fires the gun, Gordon gets up and he is free)\\r\\nAlyx-Dad!\\r\\nEli-Oh no no no. Dont worry about me honey.\\r\\nJudith-There is no time Alyx, he is on his way to the portal. You will need\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n(Judith gives Alyx the hacking tool)\\r\\nAlyx-Dr. Mossman..Judith.. Look after my father.\\r\\nJudith-Dont you worry.\\r\\nAlyx-Dad I am not saying goodbye.\\r\\nEli-Never.\\r\\nAlyx-Come on Gordon, lets go.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Alyx and Gordon get into the elevator)\\r\\nAlyx-Gordon.. We have not known each other very long, but I know you did not\\r\\nhave to do this. I had to rescue my father, but you.. well.. thanks for coming\\r\\nafter me.\\r\\nAlyx-Hey listen!\\r\\n(Breen is talking to someone)\\r\\nDr. Breen-It is me you should be concerned about, I can still deliver earth\\r\\nbut not without your help.\\r\\nAlyx-That is him!\\r\\nDr. Breen-The portal destination is untenable surely you can set the relay \\r\\ndestination elsewhere. There is no way I can survive in that environment.\\r\\nA host body? You must be joking, there is no way I can possibly..\\r\\nAlyx-There he is!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Oh alright dammit if that is what it takes. Just hurry! He is right\\r\\nbehind me!\\r\\n(Alyx uses the hacking tool on the force shield)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Oh shit!\\r\\n(Gordon picks up the gravity gun, and Breen gets into another elevator and\\r\\nshuts the door before he can get in)\\r\\nAlyx-Dammit! Not again! Huh! The gravity gun! He does not have a clue does he?\\r\\nI wonder where he is going.\\r\\n(The metal shield opens up to reveal the top of the citadel)\\r\\nAlyx-Oh my god! This is the dark fusion reactor. It powers their tunneling\\r\\nentanglement device. We will never have a chance like this again. We have to \\r\\nstop him!\\r\\n(Alyx uses the consoles)\\r\\nAlyx-I cannot shut it down, looks like he has turned control over to the other\\r\\nside. You will have to go into the core and do what you can. Get into the\\r\\nelevator and I will let you in. Do not forget to charge up your suit.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Gordon gets into the elevator and Alyx lets him down into the core, he sees\\r\\nDr. Breen in the tower in the center inside a glowing orb, as he goes up the \\r\\nchamber Breen taunts him)\\r\\nAlyx-Its Dr. Breen! There he is!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Dr. Freeman, you really should not be out there. At the moment of \\r\\nsynapse as I teleport this chamber will be bathed in deadly particles that\\r\\nhave yet to be named by human science. Perhaps when I have the leisure to do\\r\\nthe work myself, I will name one after you. That way you will not be \\r\\ncompletely forgotten. When the singularity collapses, I will be far away from \\r\\nhere, in another universe in fact. You on the other hand will be destroyed in\\r\\nevery way possible, and even some essentially impossible.\\r\\nAlyx-What the hell? Oh no, combine soldiers, where did they come from?\\r\\nDr. Breen-I do not know what you can possibly hope to achieve, apart from your\\r\\nown annihilation.\\r\\nAlyx-Do not listen to him Gordon!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I warned you this was futile.\\r\\nAlyx-He is bluffing Gordon. Do not listen to him!\\r\\n(Gordon reaches the center)\\r\\nAlyx-Great! Oh no, Breen has started his ascent! Hurry Gordon before he\\r\\nescapes!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I could have told you that was pointless Dr. Freeman.\\r\\nAlyx-Go Gordon!\\r\\nDr. Breen-Are you still with us Dr. Freeman? Not for much longer I think.\\r\\n(Gordon reaches the top)\\r\\nAlyx-Oh my god, the portal is opening!\\r\\nDr. Breen-I hope you have said your farewells.\\r\\n(Gordon uses the gravity gun to shoot the energy balls into the portal)\\r\\nDr. Breen-Go back Freeman, you have no idea what you are doing!\\r\\n(Gordon continues to wreck the portal)\\r\\nDr. Breen-You do not know what you will unleash, you could bring down this\\r\\nwhole citadel. Think, man, think of the people below!\\r\\n(Gordon blows up the portal)\\r\\nDr. Breen-NO! You need me!\\r\\nAlyx-Yes!\\r\\n(The shield covering the control room shuts off and Alyx steps out)\\r\\nAlyx-Yeah! You did it! Come on Gordon we have got to get out of here, maybe\\r\\nwe still have...\\r\\n\\r\\n(The portal collapses and explodes, time begins to slow down and the Gman\\r\\nslowly appears)\\r\\nGman-Time? Dr. Freeman? Is it really that time again? It seems as if you only\\r\\njust arrived. You have done a great deal in a small timespan. You have done\\r\\nso well that I have received some interesting offers for your services. \\r\\nOrdinarily I would not contemplate them, but these are extraordinary times.\\r\\nRather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of\\r\\nchoosing for you. If and when the time comes again.\\r\\n(The background begins to fade away into black, a greenish light appears)\\r\\nGman-I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition,\\r\\nDr. Freeman, I trust it will all make sense in the course of.. well.. I am \\r\\nreally not at liberty to say.\\r\\n(The background becomes a black tunnel with white strands of light flying by)\\r\\nGman-In the meantime, this is where I get off.\\r\\n(A door slides open in the air and the Gman steps in and the door shuts behind\\r\\nhim and the credits roll)\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of game\\r\\n\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n3.

Notes\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nSince the only format that GameFAQs accepts guides in is ASCII, I mostly didnt\\r\\nuse contractions because the apostrophe is not in the ASCII formatting,\\r\\ntherefore instead of doing this I simply typed out the two words.\\r\\nAlso where the * is, I am not censoring the word, it actually appears like\\r\\nthis in the sub-titles.\\r\\nA few people have e-mailed me asking about some of the speeches by Breen that I\\r\\nleft out of the script, this is because you dont actually HAVE to listen to them\\r\\nthe only reason I put the first one in is because at one point or another you \\r\\nwill most likely hear the entire thing, the others you can run right past.\\r\\n\"";
